SOCCER - B-LOC GET LUCKY WIN , B-PER IN SURPRISE DEFEAT . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC began the defence of their B-MISC I-MISC title with a lucky 2-1 win against B-LOC in a Group C championship match on Friday . But B-LOC saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers B-LOC . B-LOC controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when B-MISC striker B-PER I-PER took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing B-MISC keeper and into an empty net . B-PER I-PER made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area . The former B-MISC republic was playing in an B-MISC I-MISC finals tie for the first time . Despite winning the B-MISC I-MISC title two years ago , B-LOC are in the finals as outsiders . Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed B-LOC to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against B-LOC . B-PER I-PER scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a B-PER I-PER cross towards the B-MISC goal which goalkeeper B-PER I-PER appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net . It was the second costly blunder by B-LOC in four minutes . Defender B-PER I-PER rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of B-PER 's goal . B-PER I-PER had given B-LOC the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute . B-LOC then laid siege to the B-MISC penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the B-MISC defence . B-PER pulled off fine saves whenever they did . B-LOC coach B-PER I-PER said : ' ' The B-MISC own goal proved lucky for us . The B-MISC scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . ' ' B-LOC , co-hosts of the B-MISC I-MISC in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by B-ORG , are favourites to regain their title here . Hosts B-LOC play B-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC take on B-LOC on Saturday in Group A matches . All four teams are level with one point each from one game . B-ORG I-ORG - B-PER BACK FOR B-LOC AFTER A YEAR . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC recalled B-PER I-PER on Friday for their friendly against B-LOC at B-LOC more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection . B-PER , who trainer B-PER I-PER said was certain to play on Saturday week , was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by B-LOC at B-LOC last month . B-PER I-PER is out through illness and B-PER said he had dropped back row B-PER I-PER , who had been recalled for the B-LOC game after five years out of the national team . B-PER announced his retirement after the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , where he took issue with being dropped from the B-LOC side that faced B-LOC in the pool stages . B-PER said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback . " He ended the B-MISC I-MISC on the wrong note , " B-PER said . " I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available . I think now is the right time for him to return .

B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC 1996-12-06 Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders B-LOC an uninspiring 2-1 B-MISC I-MISC victory over B-LOC on Friday . B-PER I-PER headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper B-PER I-PER spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body . It was the second B-MISC defensive blunder in four minutes . Defender B-PER I-PER rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of B-PER 's goal . B-LOC had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute . B-PER I-PER headed a cross from the right by B-PER I-PER into the top right corner of B-PER I-PER 's goal .

A minute later , B-PER produced a good double save , first from B-PER I-PER 's header and then blocked a B-PER follow-up shot . B-PER saved well again from B-PER in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC forward B-PER I-PER had his indefinite suspension lifted by B-ORG on Friday and was set to make his B-ORG I-ORG comeback against B-ORG on Saturday . B-PER missed his club 's last two games after B-ORG slapped a worldwide ban on him for appearing to sign contracts for both B-ORG and B-ORG while he was playing for B-ORG . B-ORG 's players ' status committee , meeting in B-LOC , decided that although the B-ORG document was basically valid , it could not be legally protected . The committee said the B-MISC club had violated regulations by failing to inform B-ORG , with whom the player was under contract . B-PER was fined 75,000 B-MISC francs ( $ 57,600 ) for failing to inform the B-MISC club of his previous commitment to B-ORG . SOCCER - B-ORG ' B-PER FINED FOR PART IN FAST-FOOD FRACAS .

B-PER , 19 , who was caught in the act by security cameras , pleaded guilty to a charge of affray at a court in B-LOC . He was fined and ordered to pay a total of 175 pounds to two members of staff injured in the fracas in an east B-LOC restaurant in October . B-ORG had already fined B-PER 4,000 pounds ( $ 6,600 ) and warned him a repeat of his criminal behaviour could cost him his place in the side . B-PER , who moved to the B-LOC club in August for 3.5 million pounds ( $ 5.8 million ) , was expected to play against B-ORG on Saturday . BASKETBALL - B-MISC STANDINGS .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 Centre B-PER I-PER will miss B-LOC 's end-of-tour fixture against the B-ORG at B-LOC on Saturday . B-PER has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow B-MISC B-PER I-PER . B-PER I-PER has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against B-LOC and retains his place in the back-row ahead of B-PER I-PER . The B-ORG have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their B-MISC tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide B-PER I-PER with a fitting send-off in his final match in B-MISC colours . The B-ORG currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic . B-PER will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of B-ORG captain B-PER I-PER , the man who kicked B-LOC to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the B-MISC I-MISC quarter-final in B-LOC I-LOC . " B-PER has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , " said B-PER , also likely to be making his final B-LOC appearance . On tour , B-LOC have won all four tests against B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game . League duties restricted the B-ORG ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including B-LOC full-back B-PER I-PER and recalled wing B-PER I-PER , plus B-ORG I-ORG forwards B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER .

League title-holders B-ORG I-ORG , who finished bottom of their B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC group in the B-MISC I-MISC , have only two players in the squad .

B-LOC I-LOC tour manager B-PER I-PER has apologised for B-PER 's behaviour on Tuesday . He ( B-PER ) had told B-LOC coach B-PER I-PER that wicketkeeper B-PER I-PER was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room . The B-LOC crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the B-LOC I-LOC vice-captain as he walked to the middle . It was left to fellow left-hander B-PER I-PER to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin . B-PER was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC I-LOC batsman B-PER I-PER suffered another blow to his B-MISC tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against B-LOC on Friday . B-PER , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against B-LOC wicketkeeper B-PER I-PER , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat . The B-LOC I-LOC vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer B-PER I-PER straight to B-PER I-PER at mid-wicket . B-LOC I-LOC were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC after captain B-PER I-PER won the toss and elected to bat . B-PER 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the B-MISC public against him . As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd . On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him . Tour manager B-PER I-PER on Wednesday apologised for B-PER 's behaviour in confronting B-LOC coach B-PER I-PER in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday . B-PER did not say what form the discipline would take . B-PER , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about B-PER 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the B-LOC keeper . B-LOC went on to win the match at the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after B-PER failed in both innings . B-PER has yet to score a century since B-LOC I-LOC arrived in B-LOC five weeks ago . Both B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected . B-LOC , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular B-MISC I-MISC tournament . CRICKET - B-LOC I-LOC TO BAT AFTER WINNING THE TOSS .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-ORG chairman B-PER I-PER said on Friday he would personally present B-ORG I-ORG B-PER I-PER with world soccer 's fair play award despite the striker 's attack on B-ORG captain B-PER I-PER . In an interview with the B-MISC newspaper B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , he was quoted as saying B-PER had been provoked into the assault which left B-PER with a broken nose . " B-ORG has named the B-MISC for its 1996 Fair Play award and it is not going to change its decision , " B-PER said . " A reaction , provoked , cannot erase 10 years of loyalty everywhere and in every competition . " I will be happy to give him the award personally on January 20 in B-LOC and I 'm confident that B-PER himself will be there beside me on that day to shake his hand . " B-PER was suspended for one match by B-ORG , B-MISC soccer 's governing body , pending a fuller investigation . The incident took place in the players ' tunnel after a B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC match on November 20 . B-PER has admitted head butting B-PER but said he reacted to racist taunts . He has offered to apologise if B-PER acknowledges the provocation . B-PER , who needed surgery on his nose , has not accepted the offer and was reported to be considering suing B-PER . B-PER served out his suspension during B-ORG 's 2-1 home defeat by B-ORG of B-LOC on Wednesday . The defeat put the B-MISC out of the B-MISC I-MISC . GUNMEN WOUND TWO B-ORG I-ORG FANS IN B-LOC .

" The four B-MISC were shot at from a B-MISC car at around 1 a.m. , " a spokeswoman told B-ORG . The two men were hit in the pelvis and leg . Police said their lives were not in danger . The fans , in B-LOC to watch their team play B-ORG I-ORG last Wednesday , may have been involved in a pub brawl earlier , the spokeswoman said . B-ORG I-ORG won 2-0 . SOCCER - B-MISC FIRST DIVISION MATCHES THIS WEEKEND . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC B-MISC I-MISC games to be played on Sunday ( league positions in parentheses , all kick- off times B-MISC ) : B-ORG ( 4 ) v B-ORG ( 13 ) 1330 Along with leaders B-ORG , fourth-placed B-ORG represent the biggest surprise of this B-MISC autumn . Led as usual by B-MISC B-PER I-PER and B-MISC B-PER I-PER in attack , B-ORG can expect a tough home match against a B-ORG side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over B-ORG I-ORG last Sunday . B-ORG ( 16 ) v B-ORG ( 18 ) 1530 B-ORG start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with B-ORG and B-ORG in last two outings but will be without suspended B-MISC defender B-PER I-PER . Bottom team B-ORG are also without a suspended defender , B-MISC B-PER I-PER . B-ORG ( 10 ) v B-ORG ( 8 ) 1330 B-ORG will be without three suspended players -- defenders B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER and midfielder B-PER I-PER -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented B-ORG led by in-form B-MISC striker B-PER I-PER and the experienced B-PER I-PER . B-ORG ( 12 ) v B-ORG I-ORG ( 7 ) 1930 Poor man 's B-MISC derby in what has been a miserable season for both B-LOC teams , already eliminated from the B-MISC and B-MISC I-MISC . B-ORG have injury doubts about striker B-PER I-PER , B-LOC midfielder B-PER I-PER and defender B-PER I-PER , while B-ORG present a full strength side led by B-MISC B-PER I-PER , B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER in attack . B-ORG I-ORG ( 9 ) v B-ORG ( 11 ) 1330 Can B-ORG sink any further ? Following their midweek B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC elimination by B-MISC side B-ORG , a morale-boosting win is badly needed . B-MISC striker B-PER I-PER makes a welcome return for B-ORG alongside B-PER I-PER , with B-MISC B-PER I-PER in midfield . Good news for B-ORG is that B-ORG 's B-MISC striker B-PER I-PER is out through injury . B-ORG ( 5 ) v B-ORG ( 17 ) 1330 In-form B-ORG should prove too strong for second from bottom B-ORG despite the absence of their suspended B-MISC defender B-PER I-PER . B-ORG 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder B-PER I-PER . B-ORG ( 14 ) v B-ORG ( 15 ) 1330 B-ORG may field new signing , B-MISC midfielder B-PER I-PER , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over B-ORG eight weeks ago . B-ORG 's B-MISC midfielder B-PER I-PER and defender B-PER I-PER are suspended while B-MISC B-PER I-PER is out through injury . B-ORG look to B-PER I-PER , scorer of eight goals . B-ORG ( 6 ) v B-ORG ( 3 ) 1330 All-conquering B-ORG field their most recent signing , B-MISC defender B-PER , while B-PER I-PER I-PER and B-MISC B-PER I-PER lead the attack . The new world club champions may prove too strong for a B-ORG side led by captain B-PER I-PER but missing injured B-MISC midfielder B-PER I-PER . B-ORG ( 1 ) v B-ORG ( 2 ) 1330 Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless . Full strength B-ORG , led by B-MISC B-PER I-PER , may continue their surprise run at the top against an B-ORG side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws . B-ORG will be without suspended B-MISC defender B-PER I-PER and injured B-MISC striker B-PER I-PER . BASKETBALL - B-MISC RESULT .

B-PER , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-12-06 At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in B-LOC I-LOC 's volatile B-MISC heartland , police said on Friday . A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of B-LOC on B-LOC province 's south coast on Thursday night . The victims were 18 and 20 , he said , adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting . In another attack , also on the province 's south coast on Thursday night , two men were shot dead near B-LOC . " We suspect that these killings are linked to politics , " spokesman B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . There had been no arrests . The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in B-LOC and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots . They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers , some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores , flock back to their home villages . More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in over a decade of political turf wars between the B-ORG and B-MISC Chief B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in the province . B-PER PRAISES B-MISC NATIVE B-PER AS FRIEND . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC President B-PER I-PER on Friday welcomed the appointment of B-PER I-PER , who is of B-LOC extraction , as the B-LOC I-LOC ' first woman Secretary of State . In a statement B-PER , who is recovering from cancer surgery , said : " B-PER I-PER is a distinguished friend , a tested diplomat , and a true B-MISC of fine origins . " " I look forward to continuing our good relations ... with the B-LOC I-LOC and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State . I wish her well , " B-PER said in a statement to B-ORG . B-PER , who helped lead the " velvet revolution " that ousted the B-MISC regime in B-LOC in 1989 , invited B-PER , then working for a private foreign policy think tank , to advise his new democratic government in 1990 . B-PER had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital . B-PER , born B-PER I-PER to a B-MISC diplomat in 1937 , fled with her family to the B-LOC I-LOC after the B-MISC came to power in a coup in 1948 . As an academic , B-PER studied and lectured on B-LOC 's 20th century problems before becoming B-LOC ambassador to the B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC diplomats , seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of B-ORG , praised the selection of B-PER , known to be a strong supporter of alliance 's integration of former B-MISC countries . " The nomination ... is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the B-MISC cooperation , a creation of strategic partnership between B-LOC and the B-LOC , " Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . " ( B-PER ) is a convinced advocate of B-ORG enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures . " B-LOC ambassador to the B-ORG I-ORG , B-PER I-PER , told the daily B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG that B-PER " is a little light in our diplomatic heaven , " but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the B-MISC .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 Saturday 's national congress of the ruling B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent , Foreign Minister and B-ORG vice-chairman B-PER I-PER , said on Friday . " Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party 's structure , having financing of the party be more transparent ... are absolutely fundamental , " B-PER , who is also vice-premier in the government , told B-ORG . He said after June general elections in which the ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority , the B-ORG executive , led by Prime Minister B-PER I-PER , had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the B-LOC second city B-LOC . " I am convinced , that the congress will tackle these proposals , " he said . The B-ORG , a party in which B-PER often tries to emulate the style of former B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER , has been in control of B-LOC politics since winning general elections in 1992 . B-PER in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of B-PER who has spearheaded the country 's B-MISC economic reforms . The party , led by the vigorously-confident B-PER , took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of B-LOC parliament . But after the first round vote a week before , the B-ORG had the potential to win as many 79 seats . B-PER and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after the left-wing opposition consolidated , putting the centre-left B-MISC I-MISC in a strong second-place position . -- B-ORG I-ORG 42-2-2423-0003 B-LOC GOT MONEY FROM POST-WAR B-MISC ACCOUNTS . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC said on Friday that B-MISC bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to B-MISC B-MISC who died in the B-MISC , were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist B-LOC received 460,000 B-MISC francs from the accounts . " In 1970s , B-LOC received from unclaimed accounts in B-LOC a sum of 460,000 francs . What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , " B-PER told a news conference . B-LOC stands accused by Senator B-PER I-PER , chairman of the powerful B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , of agreeing to give money to B-LOC from unclaimed bank accounts of B-MISC citizens , as part of an accord on compensating B-MISC nationals whose assets had been seized in communist B-LOC . Many of these citizens were B-MISC murdered during the war , when B-MISC B-MISC invaders killed most of B-LOC 's 3.5 million B-MISC . B-PER did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between B-LOC and B-LOC on compensation to B-MISC citizens whose assets were seized by the B-MISC communists authorities after B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . " I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , " B-PER said . B-PER confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting B-LOC about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports . He said , however , that B-LOC did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called " dead accounts " as part of the compensation . " About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five B-MISC citizens , whose data we do not precisely know . The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , " B-PER said . Under pressure from international B-MISC organisations , B-MISC government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward B-MISC victims . The conservative B-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order B-MISC banks to put some 40 million B-MISC francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for B-MISC groups and charitable organisations . But B-MISC banks and the country 's B-MISC community voiced doubts whether the plan would work . B-MISC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC brewer B-ORG 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said . Company President B-PER I-PER I-PER told B-ORG in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround . So far this year B-ORG , whose full name is B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys . It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres . B-PER I-PER would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading B-MISC brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer . " The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van B-PER said on B-MISC per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres . He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make B-LOC , with its 40-million population , B-LOC 's third largest beer market after B-LOC and B-LOC . B-PER I-PER said B-LOC 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors . B-ORG is 31.8-percent owned by B-ORG while B-ORG has the same amount in B-ORG . Earlier this year B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted B-ORG and B-ORG brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG has a controlling stake in B-LOC 's larges t brewery , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . B-PER I-PER said the tough competition had prevented B-ORG from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins . He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share . But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring B-LOC I-LOC . Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality B-LOC imports could invade B-LOC once tariffs for B-ORG countries are lifted in 1998 , but van B-PER says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the B-LOC beer market 's overcapacity . " I think B-MISC consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ... I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the B-LOC beers , " he said . B-PER I-PER said B-ORG had its eye on B-ORG , which has said it would start producing B-ORG beer next year , but that B-ORG 's potential production of B-ORG was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one . He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , B-ORG B-MISC I-MISC , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand . " You will not win the war of the B-MISC beer market with imported international brands , " van B-PER said , adding that B-ORG would remain an up-market import in B-LOC . B-PER I-PER also said B-ORG would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made . -- B-ORG I-ORG +48 22 653 9700 B-PER HAS TRAECHEOTOMY AFTER CONDITIONS WORSENS . B-LOC 1996-12-06 Doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy to help B-LOC President B-PER I-PER breathe after cancer surgery on his lungs earlier this week , a spokesman said on Friday . He said that the procedure to insert a device into B-PER 's throat , done after his breathing worsened on Thursday , had helped , and the president 's condition significantly improved . " A worsening in the president 's lung functions took place yesterday , " presidential spokesman B-PER I-PER said in a statement . " A tracheotomy was performed and supportive breathing was installed through the help of a breathing device , " he said . " After these steps , the president 's condition signigicantly improved . " B-PER has been recovering from surgery on Monday which removed a small malignant tumour and half of his right lung . Doctors after the operation said that they had caught the cancer early , and that B-PER could fully recover from the surgery within six weeks . His spokesman said on Thursday that B-PER , 60 and a heavy smoker , had also developed a slight case of pneumonia in the left lung . B-MISC open skies talks end , no date to restart .

She will appear in court on Saturday . Her name was not released . Security forces said the bombs may have been intended for use in a pre-Christmas bombing campaign by the guerrilla group that is battling to oust B-LOC from B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC sets conditions to clear B-MISC alliance . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 The B-MISC government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed B-MISC alliance between B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG to B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Secretary B-PER I-PER added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC to liberalise B-MISC air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes . B-PER said he supported conditions proposed by B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which was asked to examine the case last month . " I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where B-ORG and B-ORG currently compete and for all passengers on the B-MISC market route between the B-LOC and B-LOC , " he said . His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in B-LOC with no deal signed . Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the B-MISC I-MISC deal would be cleared . The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG drop 168 slots at B-LOC I-LOC airport , the busiest in B-LOC . B-ORG 's parent , B-ORG I-ORG , said it did not view the terms as a " deal breaker . " However , it called the conditions " more severe " than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances . B-ORG I-ORG 's initial response was that " unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . " It added that it would be " prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . " The government also wants B-ORG I-ORG to drop a clause in its agreement with B-ORG that bars it from competing on B-MISC routes , and said both B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG should be prepared to reduce services on the B-LOC to B-LOC I-LOC route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter . It also suggested losing some slots on the B-MISC route . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG called for B-ORG I-ORG / B-ORG to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme . B-PER said responses should be made to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG by Jan. 10 , 1997 . Med oil products mostly lower as B-ORG strike ends . B-LOC 1996-12-06 Mediterranean oil products were steady to mostly lower on Friday after B-ORG refinery workers voted to end their nine-day strike . Gas oil erased Thursday 's gains , plunging $ 5.50 a tonne in line with the screen . Volume was very thin and market remained long , with premiums down $ 1 at about high cif quotes +$0.50 basis B-ORG . " The sharp moves on the screen make everyone nervous , " a trader said . Trades were discussed in 0.2 , 0.5 and one percent heating oil into B-LOC and B-LOC and there were fresh inquiries from B-LOC and B-LOC for low sulphur diesel . Interest remains focussed on a tender by B-LOC for a second purchase of high speed diesel for January delivery . Fuel oil lost ground sharply with weaker crude , but also suffered from some pricing pressure . High sulphur cracked fuel lost about $ 3 to $ 109-111 fob Med with several cargoes threatening to overhang the market . The chance of material heading north , talked earlier this week , may be in jeopardy now since B-MISC fuel oil is expected to head transatlantic following outages at two coking units in the B-LOC . Up to 165,000 tonnes of fuel will have to find a new home and with the arbitrage from the B-LOC to B-LOC open B-LOC is a prime candidate . Low sulphur prices were lower with cif Med pegged in the mid to low $ 140s . Gasoline prices fell after striking B-ORG refinery workers voted to go back to work , traders said . But an open arbitrage to the B-LOC and tight B-MISC supplies after B-ORG scooped up Med material over the last week , continued to underpin prices into next week . New meningitis scare hits B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-12-06 A boy has died from meningitis and a girl from the same school has contracted the disease in the second such scare to hit B-LOC in as many weeks , health authorities said on Friday . The 16-year-old who attended B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in the northern B-LOC city of B-LOC died less than a day after becoming ill . The 15-year-old girl is also suffering from the disease and hospital officials described her condition as serious . " At the moment there is no evidence the two cases are linked . However , we are assuming they are as a precaution for the time being , " a spokeswoman said . The more than 1,260 students at the school are being given antibiotics as a precaution . B-LOC grappled with its own cluster of meningitis cases on a university campus in B-LOC . At least two people have died and hundreds have been vaccinated in an effort to contain the virus . In B-LOC , eight people have died and hundreds more are fighting a widespread food-poisoning outbreak . A health authority spokeswoman said 78 people suspected of having the disease , including 64 confirmed cases , were still being treated . Three were listed in poor condition . More than 290 people have reported symptoms in B-LOC county , the worst-hit area , since the outbreak first came to light after people ate tainted meat pies at a pensioners ' lunch . B-PER 's B-MISC still have majority . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER 's office said on Friday that rebel B-MISC MP Sir B-PER I-PER had not " resigned the whip " ( quit the parliamentary party ) and the government still had a majority in the 651-seat parliament . " He ( B-PER ) isreserving the right not to cooperate , but he has not resigned the whip . The government still has a majority , " a spokesman from B-PER 's office in B-LOC I-LOC said . B-PER 's office said later the MP would not feel himself obliged to vote with the government . He said at one point during a press conference : " I have seen my whip ( party manager ) for next week which , of course , does n't mean very much to me now . " Before B-PER 's statement , B-PER had a one-seat majority in the 651-seat B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG lower house of parliament . In his formal statement , B-PER said : " I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government and shall not treat the " whip ' as either a summons to attend the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG or as placing me under any obligation to vote as advised . " B-PER resigned over a hospital closure in his constituency . B-ORG I-ORG bags flight data contract . B-LOC 1996-12-06 Information technology firm B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Friday it had bagged a contract for the first air traffic control project being funded under the Private Finance Initiative . In a statement , B-ORG said the contract would be in the region of 50 million stg . The contract involved upgrading the flight data processing system at the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC in B-LOC in south west B-LOC for B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , subsidiary of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . The system is responsible for the control of aircraft flying transatlantic routes from B-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC on Friday said that it planned a $ 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for B-MISC investors . A city official , who declined to be named , explained that B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate , proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering . By selling the floating rate debt , the city hopes to establish a benchmark , the city official said , adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective . The city in late June sold its first issue of B-MISC , a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs , and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then . In November , B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC said it became the first B-LOC municipality to offer bonds for sale in B-MISC markets by competitive bidding as it listed taxable bonds on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . The refunding planned for January also includes a $ 475 million tax-exempt offering .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-12-06 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG tops B-LOC I-LOC 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG if B-ORG I-ORG rejects unsolicited suitor B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . B-ORG I-ORG is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from B-ORG , announced Thursday . B-LOC I-LOC , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between B-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor . B-ORG said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters . Analysts predict B-ORG I-ORG will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , B-ORG may not be able to match its offer . They said the B-ORG I-ORG deal , which includes desirable B-LOC mining territory , would only payoff for B-ORG longer term . B-ORG , in fact , will not benefit from the B-ORG I-ORG acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer . Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said . Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG as B-ORG I-ORG saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting B-LOC 's B-ORG vast gold deposit . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match B-ORG I-ORG 's B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC presence , they said . A B-ORG spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list . B-ORG , based in B-LOC I-LOC , operates gold mines in the B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million . B-ORG I-ORG is headquartered B-LOC , B-LOC and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million . B-ORG I-ORG has mining and exploration operations in B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . B-ORG analyst B-PER I-PER said he lowered his rating on B-ORG to neutral from attractive today because if B-ORG merged with B-ORG I-ORG , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion . " I think B-ORG could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the B-ORG number . One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( B-ORG I-ORG ) deal with someone , " he said . " Longer term , two to three years out , ( a B-MISC I-MISC deal ) is positive , it does all the right things . But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , " the analyst added . B-ORG proposed to B-LOC I-LOC a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 B-ORG shares for each B-ORG I-ORG shares . In Friday B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG trade , B-ORG was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while B-ORG I-ORG added 1/4 to 15-1/8 . " B-ORG said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with B-ORG I-ORG , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' " said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from B-ORG . Two other arbs called B-ORG 's move a " a 32 cent bid " because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter " mailed " to B-ORG I-ORG 's board . -- B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , 212-859-1734 . B-ORG I-ORG president to retire in July .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC hanged a convicted murderer on Friday , bringing to eight the number of executions carried out in the past year . A statement said B-PER I-PER I-PER was hanged at dawn . President B-PER I-PER 's government has resisted pressure from local and international human rights groups to abolish the death sentence . Multinational commander going back to east B-LOC . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 The B-MISC general in charge of a multinational force for eastern B-LOC said on Friday he was going back to B-LOC for more information about the plight of about 165,000 B-MISC refugees adrift in the countryside . Lieutenant-General B-PER I-PER told a news conference in B-LOC his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of B-LOC . If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in B-LOC and the B-MISC rebels who control much of eastern B-LOC , he said . " Tomorrow I 'm going into B-LOC and my intention is to go across into eastern B-LOC and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , " he said . General B-PER saw rebel leader B-PER I-PER in B-LOC last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the B-MISC refugees have already gone home . The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the B-MISC army regain control of the area . B-LOC opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters . B-MISC Defence Minister B-PER I-PER said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way . " It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between B-LOC and B-LOC , " B-PER told reporters . But General B-PER said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information . " We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies . " If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary . If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , " he said . Asked if he would disregard the objections of the B-MISC government , he said : " It would have to be in the last resort . It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger . Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ? And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern B-LOC . " Under Chapter Seven of the B-ORG charter , the B-ORG I-ORG has wide powers to preserve peace and security . " I know their ( the B-MISC government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , " the general added . He denied that his contacts , criticised by B-LOC , with the B-MISC rebels amounted to negotiations . " I do n't negotiate , " he said . " I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do . When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . " B-PER said that apart from the group of 150,000 , B-LOC and B-MISC reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from B-LOC west to B-LOC . The B-LOC office of the medical charity B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the B-LOC area and many of them were now in the town of B-LOC . The general did not mention these refugees , who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking . B-LOC put on cyclone alert . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC authorities put the B-LOC I-LOC island on cyclone alert on Friday . The weather services office said the centre of the intense tropical cyclone B-MISC was 570 km ( 310 miles ) north by northwest of the island on Friday afternoon and was moving south by southwest at eight km an hour ( four knots ) . Although not threatening B-LOC directly , it is coming closer to the island and could change direction , it added . Winds up to 75 km an hour ( 40 knots ) could blow over B-LOC during the night of Friday to Saturday , it said . The weather in the capital B-LOC I-LOC was heavily cloudy on Friday afternoon with occasional showers . The northeastern coast of the nearby island of B-LOC has also gone on alert .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC 's President B-PER I-PER said on Friday he was proposing his foreign minister B-PER I-PER for the post of B-ORG I-ORG secretary-general . B-PER announced his intention to reporters when he returned from the B-MISC summit in B-LOC I-LOC where an B-MISC successor to Secretary-General B-PER I-PER was discussed . The B-LOC I-LOC has vetoed a second term for the B-MISC but left the door open for another B-MISC candidate . " If B-LOC does not wish to lose its turn we have to act fast , " B-PER said . " Some of my brother heads of state asked me if I would n't nominate B-PER I-PER . I see in him the profile of a secretray-general of the B-ORG I-ORG and I have given my endorsement . " Ex-minister , son killed in B-LOC I-LOC unrest . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 A former cabinet minister in B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital B-LOC , a government minister said on Friday . With violence spiralling out of control , B-LOC voiced backing for the elected B-LOC government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers . " B-LOC cannot be involved in the domestic political debate , " President B-PER I-PER told a news conference at the end of a B-MISC summit in B-LOC I-LOC . " B-MISC troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , " he said . Public Service Minister B-PER I-PER , who is the head of the national B-ORG I-ORG , told B-ORG he had seen the bodies of former interior minister B-PER I-PER and his son , who was not named . Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President B-PER I-PER at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 . B-PER is from the B-MISC tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong . The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple B-PER , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital . The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by B-MISC troops based in B-LOC . The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said B-PER and other witnesses . The men were seized as loyalist forces and B-MISC troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre . A B-MISC hotel was slightly damaged . B-MISC are hounded in stronghold districts of B-PER 's B-MISC people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands . Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central B-LOC , which is patrolled by B-MISC troops with tanks , is deserted . Shops and businesses have remained shut this week . The B-MISC summit decided to send a mission B-LOC to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war . B-PER said B-LOC I-LOC President B-PER I-PER would visit B-LOC " in the coming hours " with the heads of state of B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels . The mutiny forced B-PER to miss the summit . His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission . B-PER , who won B-LOC I-LOC 's first multi-party elections , refuses to resign . Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure . Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May , with B-MISC troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising . B-PER offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre . Rebels accuse B-PER of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from B-LOC and B-LOC . Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as B-MISC . Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting , including two rebels killed in Thursday 's clashes . An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups . In Thursday 's fighting , B-MISC troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre . Five die as B-MISC crop plane hits pickup .

" All four attackers were apprehended and two have been detained , " the spokesman added He was unable to give more details . " The further procedure is now in the hands of the local police investigator , " the spokesman said . It was the second attack by skinheads in two years on B-PER , an B-MISC . B-PER was not available for comment . B-MISC jailed for threat of bomb suicide . B-LOC 1996-12-06 An B-MISC court on Friday sentenced a man who threatened to blow himself up outside President B-PER I-PER 's office to 13 years in jail for guerrilla action and illegal possession of arms . B-PER last April said he would blow himself up outside the presidential palace unless he was allowed to speak to B-PER , who was at the time meeting B-MISC President B-PER I-PER I-PER . B-PER was overpowered by riot police less than one hour after he began his action . " Evaluating all the conditions of the case the court thinks the sentence should be lower than the minimum ( 15 years ) , " B-LOC judge B-PER I-PER added . The defendant denied the charges , saying his action was intended to urge the authorities to give him a $ 20,000 loan . Medical experts had concluded B-PER was mentally unstable but fully responsible for the act he had committed , B-PER said . B-MISC ex-communist president to visit Pope . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC 's ex-communist President B-PER I-PER is likely to visit Polish-born Pope B-PER I-PER in early 1997 despite uneasy relations between the B-LOC and B-LOC , the foreign minister said on Friday . " President B-PER plans to visit B-LOC on a invitation from President B-PER I-PER . A meeting with the Pope is also planned , " B-PER I-PER told a news conference . B-PER said that the atmosphere of the meeting , if it takes place , would largely depend on the progress in talks on ratification of a treaty between B-LOC and the B-LOC . @ The ratification of the treaty , which was signed in 1993 by the then right-centrist government , is being delayed by an ex-communist party , which won parliamentary elections in the same year and now dominates parliament . The party , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , says the agreement would give the B-ORG I-ORG too much influence over life in B-LOC and could infringe on rights of other religious groups and non-believers . The relations with the B-LOC have also been soured by a recent relaxation of B-LOC 's anti-abortion rules , which B-PER signed into law last month . B-LOC warns B-ORG , not expected to liquidate it . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC Finance Minister B-PER I-PER warned financially-troubled B-ORG I-ORG on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes , but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen . " B-ORG really is a big debtor , both to the federal and regional budgets , " said B-PER I-PER , equities analyst at B-LOC brokerage B-ORG I-ORG and a B-ORG watcher . " B-PER 's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company . " The official B-ORG news agency quoted B-PER as telling parliamentary deputies that B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group . " If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue , then it obviously means something , " said B-PER I-PER , chief economist at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC . " But if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded , then it was the only answer he could have given . " B-MISC tax and cabinet authorities , under pressure from the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to B-LOC , have been striking fear into the hearts of some of B-LOC 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation . " They could freeze metal , but it 's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget , " B-PER said . " I do n't think they would do that . " Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far North where B-ORG is based depend on the company , and B-LOC has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip B-ORG 's debts . B-ORG officials declined to comment . Analysts said the government , while anxious about B-ORG 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring the nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output . But it also wants B-ORG , the world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act . " The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied , " B-ORG quoted B-PER as telling B-ORG deputies about B-ORG . It indirectly quoted him as saying B-ORG should first pay salary arrears , which in the past have led to worker strikes . " It is unlikely that B-ORG will pay these debts in the near-term -- the company will remain a debtor in the near future , " B-PER said . He estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant B-LOC regional budget was fuelled by B-ORG money . B-ORG 's new majority shareholder , B-MISC commerical bank B-ORG , has said it is reorganising metal exports through B-ORG in order to boost revenues . But the changes have yet to improve significantly B-ORG 's situation . " B-ORG has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen , " said one metals source . B-ORG said in September that it total debts , including unpaid salaries to workers , were 13 trillion roubles . The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities , after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets . -- B-ORG I-ORG , +7095 941 8520 B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG 11-mo net 46.6 mln kroons .

It said in a statement that it made profits of 4.5 million kroons in November . The bank made a profit of 20.1 million kroons in the first half of the year .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC said on Friday it expected a constructive relationship with B-PER I-PER , nominated by B-LOC President B-PER I-PER to be Secretary of State . B-ORG news agency quoted First Deputy Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER as saying B-LOC was ready for " most active and constructive " work with B-PER . But he noted that policy would be shaped by B-PER and President B-PER I-PER . B-PER and B-PER are due to meet next March for their first summit since both were re-elected . " Our countries ' leaders have agreed to meet in March , 1997 . The B-MISC foreign ministry believes the new directions in the development of B-MISC relations will be worked out there , " B-PER told B-ORG . B-ORG , outlining B-PER 's biography , pointed out that she had defended B-LOC 's interests fiercely as B-LOC ambassador to the B-ORG I-ORG and that this had included actively supporting B-ORG 's plans to expand eastwards . B-LOC opposes B-ORG 's plans to take in countries of eastern and central B-LOC which used to be part of the B-MISC B-MISC I-MISC , saying such moves would threaten its security . B-PER plans return to B-LOC for Dec 25 - speaker . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC President B-PER I-PER , who had heart bypass surgery a month ago , plans to return to work on December 25 , the head of the upper chamber of parliament told B-ORG news agency on Friday . " Today he is a mobile , energetic man with lots of colour in his cheeks , " said B-PER I-PER who met B-PER , 65 , on Friday at a country residence . " He told me that he had lost 20 kg ( 44 lbs ) which is natural after such an operation . " December 25 , a normal working day in B-LOC , is the fifth anniversary of B-PER 's arrival in the B-LOC . He took over there , and took control of the red button controlling nuclear arms , in December 1991 when B-PER I-PER resigned , marking the end of the B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER has been shown a few times on television since his quintuple bypass on November 5 but has yet to deliver any major television or radio address to the nation . Surgeon B-PER I-PER who led the operation , told B-ORG news agency B-PER was working up to four hours a day at his residence . Bomb explodes outside home of expelled B-MISC MP . B-LOC 1996-12-06 A bomb exploded on Friday outside the home of a B-MISC politician expelled from parliament after he quit the ruling party , complaining of a lack of democracy in the country . The official B-ORG news agency said the explosion blew out all ground floor windows of B-PER I-PER 's family home in B-LOC , western B-LOC , and damaged the main entrance , but no-one was injured . B-PER , formerly a member of Prime Minister B-PER I-PER 's ruling B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , was stripped of his parliamentary mandate on Wednesday after leaving the party last month in protest over what he said was a lack of democracy in the country . He said he had been receiving anonymous death threats since making the move . " This was an act of terrorism and now I fear not only for my own life , but also of that of my wife and children , " he told B-ORG . B-PER 's family was sleeping in a bedroom at the back of the house and were unharmed by the blast . It was not immediately clear who was behind the blast . Bomb explodes at mosque in central B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-12-06 A bomb exploded on Friday at a mosque in the central B-MISC town of B-LOC , causing damage but no injuries , state radio said . Violent crime has soared since the collapse of communism in 1989 as B-LOC moves to a market economy . Bombings are often carried out by criminals to settle scores but the motive in this case was not immediately clear . Some residents of the B-LOC area are B-MISC who converted to B-MISC during Ottoman B-MISC rule . The majority in B-LOC are B-MISC . The radio quoted police as saying the blast broke windows and shattered the door of the mosque . B-LOC o / n rates end up before Dec 10 tax payment . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC overnight interest rates closed higher on Friday as market liquidity tightened before the December 10 social security contribution payment deadline , dealers said . " The banks are already preparing for the December 10 tax payment , " said B-LOC Bank 's B-PER I-PER . " They expect a larger-than-average payment . " The overnight market opened at 22.00 / 22.75 percent , then substantial money was taken up at 22.5 percent . But later , rates dropped and closed at 22.00 / 22.25 as a large bank finished borrowing money . On Thursday , overnight rates moved between 21.625 and 22.125 . Dealers said liquidity could tighten further early next week as the social security contribution payments date approaches . -- B-PER I-PER , B-LOC newsroom ( 36 1 ) 327 4040 B-LOC stocks off lows but still hit by B-PER . B-LOC I-LOC B-MISC stocks closed sharply lower Friday , but had made a tentative recovery as initial panic and volatility abated . " It was B-PER at first . Then once we saw the B-MISC ( B-MISC industrial average ) was not about to crash , some buyers stepped in , " said a trader , referring to B-ORG I-ORG Chairman B-PER I-PER , whose comments that assets were " irrationally exhuberant " upset financial markets worldwide . The blue-chip B-MISC index ended down 1.29 points , or 43.56 percent , at 3,333.05 . Volume was regular at 74.7 million shares traded . B-MISC stocks were also hurt by B-LOC long bond rates which had begun to rise before B-PER 's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in B-LOC . Yields on B-LOC 30-year B-ORG bonds were 6.51 percent when stock trading closed in B-LOC , unchanged from Thursday . On the broad market , 107 stocks changed hands , of which losers well outnumbered winners by 75 to 13 . Traders noted the lack of blue chips or stocks traded at significant volume among the gainers . B-ORG , the steelmaking arm of the debt-ridden B-ORG group headed the losers , off 7 centavos ( 1 cent ) at 1.40 pesos ( 18 cents ) . B-ORG fell 4 centavos ( 1 cent ) to 95 centavos ( 12 cents ) . Traders also remarked that B-MISC B-MISC suffered in B-LOC I-LOC . Heavyweights B-ORG and B-ORG ended off 25 cents and 75 cents , respectively , at $ 31.125 and $ 25.875 . " Falling share prices in B-LOC I-LOC do n't hurt B-LOC as long as it happens gradually , as earlier this week . It 's a sudden plunge that takes its toll , " said B-PER I-PER , research director at B-LOC . Traders and analysts differed as to how firm the relative recovery on Friday was . " Some buyers stepped in , but the market was not very convinced . Volume was lackluster , " said one trader . " The market 's very healthy , we 're buying , " said another trader . B-PER said shares were certainly attractively priced in B-LOC , but would not appreciate until foreign buyers stepped in , which they had yet to do . ' Plastic surgery gets boost in B-LOC . B-PER I-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC 1996-12-06 Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as B-MISC spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday . The number of plastic surgeries in B-LOC has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , B-PER I-PER , the president of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , said . The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said . " B-LOC ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences . Our statistics are the highest for everything , " B-PER said . " We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market . People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in B-LOC I-LOC 's economy . " A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery . B-LOC has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , B-PER I-PER . There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the B-ORG . Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in B-LOC and medical students from all over the world come to study there . B-PER attributes B-LOC 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . " What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said . B-LOC 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each . Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere B-MISC tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants . " The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the B-LOC I-LOC , " B-ORG Vice-President B-PER I-PER said . " Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . " Plastic surgery scares like the case in which B-MISC model B-PER I-PER fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent . B-PER said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now . Daily B-MISC grain fixings - Camaras Arbitrales .

B-PER 1996-12-05 B-LOC and B-LOC will start negotiations next year to broaden their free trade agreement to include services and investments , B-ORG Minister B-PER I-PER said . B-LOC hopes to broaden the treaty signed in 1994 beyond reduction of tariffs on imports and exports and add provisions covering services and investment codes , said B-PER . Both areas tend to more laden with friction in free trade negotiations than tariff reduction . ' ' In January or February , we 'll have some very close contacts with B-LOC to add the issue of services and advance on the issue of investments , ' ' B-PER told reporters after signing a free trade deal with B-LOC . ' ' We want to give the treaty between B-LOC and B-LOC greater depth and coverage than it has now . It 's very good now , but it practically only covers trade in goods , ' ' he said .

Witnesses said B-PER left the territory for the B-MISC capital B-LOC accompanied by five other people . It was not immediately known when he would arrive in B-LOC . The bishop will jointly receive the B-MISC award next Tuesday with B-MISC I-MISC activist B-PER I-PER I-PER , who lives in self-exile in B-LOC . The B-MISC government has condemned the inclusion of B-PER I-PER in the award , and Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER said on Friday that B-LOC would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the B-MISC capital . " I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as B-PER I-PER ... will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to B-LOC I-LOC ) , " B-PER said on Friday . He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) in B-LOC . B-PER I-PER has been a vocal leader of the opposition to B-LOC 's rule in the territory . B-PER and B-PER I-PER were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of B-LOC I-LOC , a former B-MISC colony which B-LOC invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year . The B-ORG I-ORG has never recognised B-LOC 's move . B-PER said the government 's position on the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC would have been different if it had been awarded solely to B-PER . Asked if the B-MISC ambassador to B-LOC would have attended the ceremony if only B-PER had been involved , B-PER replied : " Probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . " B-PER said on Tuesday that on his way back from B-LOC , B-PER would visit the B-LOC to see the Pope , and would also meet B-MISC Chancellor B-PER I-PER in B-LOC . B-PER had wanted to meet B-PER during the chancellor 's official visit to B-LOC last month , but the bishop was too busy in B-LOC I-LOC to come to B-LOC . B-LOC to open port in B-LOC to foreign ships . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG , or cabinet , has given a port in the southern province of B-LOC permission to open to foreign vessels , the B-ORG news agency said on Friday . B-ORG did not say when B-LOC port in B-LOC city would be opened to foreign vessels . B-LOC has built a berth for 5,000 deadweight-tonne container ships at the port and invested 34 million yuan ( $ 4.1 million ) to dredge the harbour , B-ORG said . It gave no further details . ( $ 1 = 8.3 yuan ) Government disperses protest with water cannons . B-LOC 1996-12-07 B-MISC troops and riot police moved in to disperse a student street protest at a suburban road junction near the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG early on Saturday , witnesses said . They said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at the centre of the junction at about 3 a.m. before they moved in to round them up . The students , who had staged an 11-hour protest at the junction in northern B-LOC , were taken away in three vehicles . The witnesses said some of the students were hit with batons while they were herded onto the vehicles and it was believed they were taken to the B-LOC prison in suburban B-LOC . The protesting students , mostly from B-ORG I-ORG , were demanding the right to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail . They were among 500 students who started demonstrating at the intersection on late Friday afternoon . The protest was the second major one in five days in the capital . B-MISC students march briefly out of campus . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 About 200 B-MISC students marched briefly from troubled B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in northern B-LOC on Friday towards the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said . Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute . There were no clashes . " They are now back in the B-ORG campus , " an institute official who declined to be identified told B-ORG by telephone . One of two roads leading to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG from the institute had been closed by authorities . But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said . They were singing peacefully . On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October . On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests . She was allowed to move freely on Thursday . The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central B-LOC . The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising . Thousands were killed or imprisoned . Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government . They told B-ORG they were unhappy that the ruling B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus . " We still want government answers to our demands . We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , " one student said . But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . B-PER I-PER , a B-MISC laureate and daughter of independence hero B-PER I-PER , and key B-ORG officials have also denied any link with the students . But they have said both parties had a " moral link " in that they were against police brutality and injustice . The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the B-LOC institute in October . The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration . The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising . On Friday , the road leading to B-PER I-PER 's lakeside residence in central B-LOC remained closed by police . Union leaders outraged by B-ORG snub to B-ORG head . B-LOC 1996-12-06 International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's B-ORG meeting in B-LOC . B-PER I-PER , general secretary of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a B-ORG invitation to B-ORG director general B-PER I-PER was " outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world " . B-PER said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links . " It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , " B-PER said after the opening of an B-ORG conference on international labour standards and trade . The three-day trade union conference in B-LOC hopes to push labour issues onto the B-ORG agenda . B-PER said the B-ORG 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour . The B-ORG said it wanted the B-ORG conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union . B-PER I-PER , chairman of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , told B-ORG before the news conference he was " not too surprised , but very disappointed " that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn . " Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , " he said , adding that the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) seemed particularly hostile to the B-ORG agenda . B-ORG groups B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC , the B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . The B-ORG wants a trade and labour rights " social clause " included in the final ministerial statement issued by B-ORG leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering . Speaking to B-ORG delegates , B-PER I-PER , director of the B-ORG secretariat , said the B-ORG was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems . But he said the B-ORG 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the B-ORG . B-MISC rubber demand seen outstripping production . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Friday . B-PER I-PER said at the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC here B-MISC production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes . For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , B-PER added . " Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said . B-MISC synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes . B-PER estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 . Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes . In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes . One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the B-ORG I-ORG official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although B-PER said this may not be possible at this time in B-LOC . " The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , " he said . -- B-ORG I-ORG ( 65-8703305 ) B-LOC 's authorities seen seeking to rein in dollar .

In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) governor , B-PER I-PER was quoted in B-LOC 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen . This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by B-PER I-PER , a high-ranking B-ORG I-ORG official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen . But many in the market thought B-PER 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the B-LOC government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said . " I think his views on ( B-ORG I-ORG Secretary B-PER ) B-PER 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , " said B-PER I-PER , chief dealer at B-ORG I-ORG . Asked about B-PER 's comment that a strong dollar was in B-LOC interests , B-PER said the remark does not necessarily mean the B-LOC I-LOC supports a stronger dollar . " It 's a strong dollar , not stronger . In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , " he said . " It shows that B-PER is not for a stronger dollar either , " said B-ORG 's B-PER . B-PER I-PER , first vice president at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC , said : " Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to B-PER ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . " Market participants have kept a close eye on B-PER , chief of the ministry 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply . He had said then that the market 's view on B-LOC 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought . Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the " B-PER ceiling " for the dollar following the remark . Adding to the comments by " B-PER I-PER " , as B-PER is known for his prominence in the currency market , was B-ORG governor B-PER 's remark . " The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , " B-PER said in an interview with the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the B-ORG does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , " said B-PER I-PER , chief forex manager at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about B-LOC 's economy . " There was concern that foreign investors may sell B-MISC stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen . The B-ORG does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy , " said B-PER I-PER , market strategist with B-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC . Senior B-ORG officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative . " I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , " a senior B-ORG official told B-ORG on Friday . The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent . B-LOC sentences B-MISC warlord to death . B-ORG I-ORG B-LOC 1996-12-06 A B-MISC military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of B-LOC 's surrogate militia in south B-LOC on treason charges . The court convicted General B-PER I-PER , head of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , of collaborating with B-LOC with which B-LOC is officially at war . B-PER , a 69-year-old former B-MISC army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong B-ORG militia which helps B-LOC hold a border zone in south B-LOC to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern B-LOC . B-PER said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that B-MISC authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the B-MISC state . He said B-LOC was capable of pressuring B-LOC 's B-MISC government to stop the legal pursuit . The charges against B-PER were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on B-LOC 's side , helping B-LOC strip off a part of B-MISC territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill B-MISC civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping B-MISC citizens for long periods . Shortly before B-PER 's trial began , a B-LOC military prosecutor charged another 89 former B-MISC army soldiers with collaborating with B-LOC . No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the B-ORG living in the B-MISC zone in south B-LOC . B-LOC and B-PER have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the B-ORG -- a mixed B-MISC B-MISC force -- which the B-MISC states regards as loyal allies . B-LOC has said the B-MISC army must incorporate the B-ORG fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace . But B-MISC political analysts have said that would be out of the question and B-MISC authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against B-PER . Former B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER , calling B-PER " a great B-MISC patriot " , said earlier this year B-LOC had insulted the B-ORG commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges . B-PER , who was ousted in May by rightwing B-MISC leader B-PER I-PER , said there could not be real negotiations with B-LOC " unless it will stop the maltreatment of the B-ORG and its commanders . " The B-LOC military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia B-PER I-PER , former head of the B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a small rightwing B-MISC civil war militia . B-PER , whose trial was concurrent with B-PER 's , was convicted of " contacting the B-MISC enemy , passing information to B-LOC and undertaking hostile acts against B-LOC " .

As B-PER I-PER , a rural B-LOC minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , B-PER was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 B-MISC ) for the murder of B-PER I-PER . Speaking in B-MISC , B-PER made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER , who was present at the execution . " I bear witness that there is no B-PER but B-PER and I bear witness that the prophet B-PER is the messenger of B-PER , " he quoted B-PER as saying . Prison officials said they had no record of B-PER ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , B-PER I-PER I-PER , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to B-MISC . B-PER is the 38th person to die in B-LOC 's electric chair since the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty . Prison officials said B-PER made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him . He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser , B-PER said . B-PER was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . On Thursday , the 11th Circuit B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC denied his appeal in federal court . In March 1982 , B-PER and accomplice B-PER I-PER knocked on the door of B-PER I-PER 's trailer in an attempt to rob it , police said . B-PER I-PER was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron . B-PER then fired two shots that killed B-PER as the victim tried to run away .

The Humane Society of the B-LOC I-LOC estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children . " Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog , " B-PER I-PER of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC , B-LOC , told the annual meeting of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them . Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction . Let 's respect their territories , " he said . B-PER said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children . He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed . B-PER I-PER , president of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female . The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , B-MISC , B-MISC I-MISC , B-MISC I-MISC and B-MISC . " The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique . Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a B-MISC . Today , B-MISC are on the way up , " B-PER said . If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until the dog goes away .

Four B-MISC said to vie for top B-ORG post . B-PER I-PER B-ORG I-ORG 1996-12-06 Four B-MISC states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of B-ORG secretary-general on Friday now that B-PER I-PER has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election . The nominees , according to diplomats , are : B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , the B-ORG undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; B-PER I-PER I-PER of B-LOC , the former B-ORG special envoy for B-LOC ; B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC I-LOC , its foreign minister and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG president in 1994-95 ; and B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , the secretary-general of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Representatives of the B-ORG missions of B-LOC , the B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC have scheduled a meeting with B-ORG I-ORG president B-PER I-PER of B-LOC to hand in the nominations in writing , the envoys said . It was not known if other candidates would step forward . Diplomats said General B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , a B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country . B-PER on Wednesday opened the door for other B-MISC to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race . His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse . The B-LOC I-LOC on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 B-ORG I-ORG members supported him . The move by the B-MISC states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee . The B-ORG I-ORG has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members B-ORG I-ORG before December 31 when B-PER 's term expires .

" B-PER told state radio B-LOC he met B-PER thanks to the good offices of B-PER I-PER , B-ORG 's leader in the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( lower house ) , and had overcome their differences . B-PER , 33 , resigned from the parliamentary party group for what she said were strictly political reasons . The fiery politician , who is also a niece of screen star B-PER I-PER , had accused B-ORG leaders of stifling internal party debate . B-PER , who sits in the B-ORG , told B-ORG I-ORG newspaper last month after quitting B-ORG 's parliamentary party that she was considering joining the neo-fascist B-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) formed by some of the Duce 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC followers . B-MISC B-PER in bank nearly gets arrested .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 The B-ORG I-ORG and B-LOC have resolved disagreements over a new B-MISC oil import regime , the B-ORG I-ORG said on Friday . The B-ORG had objected to increases in B-MISC tariffs on imports of gasoline and gasoil products introduced on January 1 , 1996 , saying they contravened levels envisaged in the so-called B-LOC Agreement between the B-ORG and B-LOC . The increases were aimed at protecting the B-MISC market while helping to modernise the local oil industry . " The B-ORG and B-LOC have now reached a final settlement regarding issues related to the B-MISC import regime in the oils sector , " the B-ORG said in a statement . Under the agreement , B-LOC will abolish all oil import tariffs by 2001 , remove all oil price controls and end quantitative restrictions on imports by January 1 , 1997 . The agreement includes the early privatisation and modernisation of B-MISC oil refineries , which will be obliged to offer equal treatment to all buyers . The B-ORG and B-LOC will monitor the settlement at six-monthly meetings . B-MISC party forces B-LOC parliament to adjourn . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC nationalists forced adjournment of B-LOC 's lower house of parliament on Friday , in protest against a proposal to observe a minute 's silence over the destruction of a mosque by a B-MISC mob in 1992 . Members of the B-MISC nationalist B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) shouted B-MISC slogans in the house after a communist deputy made the proposal in remembrance of the Babri mosque , which was razed on December 6 , 1992 . The house was first adjourned for two hours . When it reconvened , B-ORG deputies resumed the slogan-shouting , and deputy speaker B-PER I-PER suspended work until Monday . The destruction of the 16th-century mosque in the northern B-MISC town of B-LOC triggered nationwide B-MISC violence in which more than 3,000 people were killed . B-MISC officials blame revenge-minded B-MISC underworld gangs in B-LOC for a string of bombings in the city three months later that killed 260 people . The B-ORG backs a hardline B-MISC campaign to build a temple at the site of the mosque , which B-MISC believe was the birthplace of the Lord B-PER . The campaign catapulted B-ORG from the political fringe to become B-LOC 's main opposition party in 1991 . B-MISC Sept crude oil output falls to 2.6 mln T .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 High-flying B-LOC topped the league in a week of meagre returns on government bonds , B-ORG I-ORG said on Friday . In local currency terms , B-MISC BTPs offered returns of 0.85 percent in the week ended on Thursday , with fellow high-yielder B-LOC close behind on 0.80 percent . The weekly government bond index rose 0.07 percent in local currency terms . B-LOC managed third place with 0.68 percent in the 16-nation world government bond index . B-LOC 's were the worst performing bonds . They lost 2.21 percent , depressed by a wave of new B-MISC supply . Returns on B-MISC were also in negative territory at minus 0.24 percent , the poorest result after B-LOC and B-MISC gilts which lost 0.28 percent . B-LOC was the only dollar-bloc country in the table to eke out a positive return , albeit a paltry 0.02 percent . B-MISC Bunds were not much better , offering returns of 0.05 percent , while B-MISC government bonds managed a 0.38 percent gain . B-MISC bonds , which had been top performers in B-ORG I-ORG ' league table for November as a whole , turned in a more subdued weekly performance with a return of only 0.27 percent . In B-LOC dollar terms , B-LOC was the only country to give positive returns at 1.35 percent . B-LOC lost 0.37 percent , followed by B-LOC on minus 0.59 percent . The biggest losers in dollar terms were B-MISC gilts , which shed 3.41 percent , B-LOC with minus 3.03 percent and B-LOC at minus 1.54 percent . B-ORG 's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity , weighted for market capitalisation . Only bonds freely available to institutional investors and with a certain minimum amount outstanding are included .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 Relations between Chancellor of the Exchequer B-PER I-PER and Prime Minister B-PER I-PER are good despite media reports of a rift over B-MISC policy , a spokesman for B-PER 's office said on Friday . Asked about the reports , the spokesman said : " Relations are good . " Asked about B-PER 's mood after a day of media speculation about his political fortunes , the spokesman said : " He is resolute . He is getting on with the job . " The spokesman said he was not aware of any meetings overnight between B-PER and B-PER , nor of any talks between the prime minister and parliamentary business managers . Both B-PER and B-PER were in their constituencies on Friday . Two dead after executive jet crashes in B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-12-06 Two people were killed when an executive jet en route to B-LOC from B-LOC crashed on approach to an airport in B-LOC , B-LOC , on Friday , authorities said . The pilot and co-pilot , the only two aboard , were killed in the crash of the B-MISC I-MISC , airport manager B-PER I-PER said in a telephone interview . B-PER said the plane last reported to air traffic control at about 3 A.M. local time / 1:30 A.M. EST ( 0630 B-MISC ) when it began its final approach about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from the airport in this east coast B-MISC province . That was the last communication the aircraft made with the airport , he added . " We considered it as being missing until about 0600 ( 4:30 A.M. EST ) ( 0930 B-MISC ) . That 's when the wreckage was discovered , " B-PER said . He said the cargo flight originated in B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC , and was due to stop at B-LOC for refueling before going to B-LOC , B-LOC . The cause of the crash was not yet known . Investigators were due to fly to B-LOC later on Friday . B-ORG says B-PER , B-PER could meet Saturday . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-ORG negotiators said on Friday B-MISC President B-PER I-PER , B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER and B-MISC President B-PER I-PER might all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on B-LOC 's handover of B-LOC to the B-ORG . " It is very possible that B-PER and B-PER will meet in B-LOC on Saturday . There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by President B-PER , " one B-ORG official , who requested anonymity , told B-ORG . B-MISC officials said no meeting had yet been set . B-PER 's adviser B-PER I-PER I-PER said : " President B-PER is ready to meet Prime Minister B-PER but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet . " President B-PER 's position is clear that such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results . Especially since the B-LOC issue has not been agreed yet and the crucial disputed issues have not been resolved . " But B-PER said B-PER would go to B-LOC on Saturday for talks with B-PER . Both B-PER and B-PER have expressed willingness to meet . They last met in B-LOC after clashes in September that killed 60 B-MISC and 15 B-MISC . The violence was spurred by B-LOC 's opening an entrance to a tunnel near B-MISC sites in B-LOC . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with B-LOC on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of B-LOC to B-ORG rule had been " meaningless " , necessitating an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting . B-PER 's adviser B-PER I-PER said on Thursday there were efforts to arrange a meeting between the B-MISC and B-MISC leaders . B-ORG I-ORG Secretary General B-PER I-PER said on Thursday he understood it could be held in B-LOC either on Friday or Sunday . B-PER had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the B-MISC sabbath . But the B-MISC sabbath ends at sundown , so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance . B-LOC hindered by own landmines on B-MISC border . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC 's efforts to prevent B-MISC rebels and smugglers infiltrating from B-LOC are being badly hindered because the military does not have a map of its own minefields on the border , a commission of parliamentarians said . " It is not known exactly where the mines have been sown because a minefield chart cannot be found , " the commission said in a report on border protection . The report , to be debated in parliament in coming weeks , was seen by B-ORG on Friday . " Officials say the minefields present an obstacle to the security forces , " it said . It said B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) guerrillas sometimes know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the security forces . " Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines , defused them and opened up wide paths in some areas . They can come in and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle , " it said . An armed forces spokesman was not available for comment . B-LOC says B-LOC sponsors the B-ORG , fighting for B-MISC self-rule in southeast B-LOC . B-LOC denies aiding the rebels . The B-ORG also crosses into B-LOC from bases in the mountains of northern B-LOC . More than 21,000 people have died in the 12-year-old conflict . Three dead in B-MISC militia blood feud in B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-12-06 Three people were killed on Friday in a gun battle between rival groups of anti-guerrilla militiamen on the streets of this southeastern B-MISC city , police said . Four others were wounded in the clash , caused by a blood feud between two families , the B-PER and B-PER , serving as state-paid village guards against B-MISC rebels . Police said the guards fired automatic weapons at each other . One of the dead was a civilian passer-by . The role of the 70,000 mainly B-MISC village guards who fight B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) guerrillas in the southeast has been questioned recently after media allegations that many of them are involved in common crime . The head of the region 's main pro-state militia is at the centre of a security scandal that has shaken the government . More than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year-old conflict between B-MISC security forces and the B-ORG , fighting for B-MISC autonomy or independence .

B-LOC 1996-12-05 The B-LOC I-LOC Thursday blasted the release from a B-MISC prison of a B-MISC guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 , saying the move " does not make sense . " " All of us who have been victimised by terrorists ... need to stand together against terrorists . We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world , " B-ORG I-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER said . ' B-PER I-PER " is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars . It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave B-LOC before serving his just sentence ... This is an incomprehensible move . It does not make sense , " B-PER told a news briefing . He spoke after B-PER left B-LOC Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years . The B-PER administration 's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the B-MISC government , B-PER said . B-PER I-PER was whisked from B-LOC maximum security prison just outside B-LOC to the airport where he boarded a regular B-ORG I-ORG flight to B-LOC where he would transit to B-LOC and the former B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG headquarters . B-PER , 46 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a B-MISC court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a B-MISC I-MISC airliner in 1982 . His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 . A parole court ruled recently that B-PER could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years , with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term , but said he must be expelled immediately from B-LOC . The B-LOC I-LOC accuses B-PER of belonging to the May 15 B-MISC guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master B-MISC bombmaker B-PER I-PER . Three B-ORG agents who testified against B-PER during the trial , held at B-LOC prison , said they had ample evidence against B-PER for a bomb planted on a B-MISC I-MISC plane in B-LOC in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a B-ORG airliner approaching B-LOC in 1986 which killed four B-LOC citizens . School football player banned for slashing opponents . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-12-05 A B-LOC I-LOC high school football player who used razor-sharp helmet buckles to slash opponents and a referee was expelled from high school banned Thursday from competition for one year . B-PER I-PER , 17 , was expelled from B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC after an October game in which he used the sharpened chin strap buckles to injure two opposing players and the referee . One of the players need 10 stitches to a cut on his forearm . Officials said the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG decided to bar B-PER from any inter-scholastic competition until next October , regardless of the school he attends . B-PER 's father , B-PER I-PER , had admitted filing the metal buckles to a fine edge , saying he did it to get even with the referee and with players who had roughed up his son in a previous game . Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 In a gloomy B-LOC conference centre built before the dawn of the B-MISC , groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age . But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether . After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time . Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases . " If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions , " a frustrated Western delegate said . " They announced they will start evening sessions next week . " Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by B-MISC companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices . " It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles . It 's fair use . We can read sports statistics or stock prices . But with the treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , " said B-PER I-PER , a consumer lobbyist heading the B-MISC B-PER I-PER on Technology . " None of the treaties are ready to move . These people do n't understand what they 're doing . " At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry -- the coming medium for the distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce . Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by the century-old B-MISC I-MISC . But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries . A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the B-MISC . B-LOC 's state copyright official , B-PER I-PER , said apologetically that he had just arrived from B-LOC I-LOC and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda . " We do n't have money for B-MISC in B-LOC , " he added . B-PER I-PER , deputy legal chief at B-LOC 's foreign ministry , said B-LOC had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace . He too had never browsed the Net . " I 've never tried it and why should I ? There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either , " he said . A visit to the computer centre offering B-MISC services found a lone B-MISC official clicking away on his mouse . " B-MISC is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway , " said B-PER I-PER , vice-president of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a trade association of B-LOC network companies opposing the treaties . " But there are a lot of dinosaurs here . People here do n't understand B-MISC technology . Because they do n't understand technology , they fear the unknown . " Before the B-MISC , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood . Their enemies were tangible if elusive , such as the people who pirated music cassettes . But the B-MISC , a global computer network where anything from music to software can be duplicated and distributed at the click of a computer mouse , has ripped up the rulebooks . B-MISC operators said the draft laws would hold them responsible for copyright infringements in the system and expose them to multi-billion-dollar liabilities . " There are 500 million messages transmitted through the B-MISC everyday , " said B-PER I-PER of the B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " How can we control them all ? " B-LOC evacuates 17 nuns and priests from B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC said on Friday it had evacuated 17 B-MISC I-MISC nuns and priests from B-LOC where they had been at risk from fighting between government troops and ethnic B-MISC rebels . The B-ORG I-ORG said the 10 B-MISC and seven B-MISC took a special flight from the B-LOC national park in northern B-LOC to the B-MISC capital B-LOC where they were being looked after at the B-MISC embassy . The group had travelled from their mission on the edge of the park to a landing strip to make the rendezvous , a ministry official said . The ministry said the group consisted of 13 nuns , seven B-MISC and six B-MISC , and four priests , two from B-LOC , one from B-LOC and one from B-LOC . Third B-LOC blast victim was B-MISC student . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC B-PER I-PER , the third person to die after a bombing on a B-LOC train , was a 25-year-old student about to submit a mathematics doctorate , the B-MISC embassy said on Friday . B-PER died of his injuries on Thursday night , two days after the blast . A newly-married B-MISC woman and a man from B-LOC I-LOC died instantly in the bomb that injured 90 others in the rush-hour train . An embassy spokesman said B-PER , the son of a B-MISC army colonel , had been due to take his doctorate in March and hoped to become a teacher . Investigators have said the explosion bore the hallmarks of B-MISC B-MISC fundamentalists who staged a series of bombings last year which killed eight people and injured more than 160 . B-MISC President urges separatists to turn back . MANTUA , B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC President B-PER I-PER I-PER visited the symbolic heartland of the separatist B-ORG I-ORG on Friday and appealed to its supporters to drop their campaign for a breakaway state . Addressing a convention on B-MISC unity in Mantua , where the party has set up its own " parliament of the north " , B-PER made a direct appeal to what he called " my friends from the B-ORG " to work instead for federal reform . " It is an invitation , a commitment , a promise . B-LOC 's march together , " B-PER , a northerner himself , said . " Help B-LOC to teach , to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy , for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood . But turn back from the line you are taking now , " he said . B-PER was in B-LOC to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by B-MISC rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of B-MISC who had campaigned for national unity . He was jeered and whistled at by a small group of B-LOC supporters when he arrived for a visit marked by heavy security . Witnesses said the protesters were outnumbered by other B-MISC who waved tricolour flags in the national red , white and green or shouted " Viva B-LOC " . The B-ORG won more than eight percent of votes at the last general election in April on a federalist platform but its leader B-PER I-PER later switched to a separatist agenda . A three-day " independence " march along the B-LOC River in September , culminating in a declaration in B-LOC of a self-styled " B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC " , flopped badly .

B-LOC 1996-12-06 A " B-MISC " member of the ruling B-MISC party said on Thursday B-MISC finance minister B-PER I-PER had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single B-MISC currency . Member of Parliament B-PER I-PER said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year . " We have a divided and split B-ORG . This cannot endure , " B-PER told B-ORG television 's B-MISC programme on Thursday . " It is not sustainable . B-PER I-PER has to go . If he does n't resign , the prime minister has got to fire him . " B-PER 's comment come on the heels of speculation that B-PER had threatened to resign if the government changed its " wait and see " policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament . B-PER denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister B-PER I-PER . B-PER told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership . His statement was interpreted as a significant victory for B-PER and fellow B-MISC B-PER I-PER , deputy prime minister . B-MISC B-MISC MP B-PER I-PER told the B-ORG that if B-PER resigned , other ministers would go with him . Court ejects head of B-MISC child-sex inquiry . B-LOC 1996-12-06 The B-MISC opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in the B-MISC diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside . The court said inquiry head B-PER I-PER might be biased , since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity , even though he still had months ' of investigation before him . " Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service , " opposition foreign affairs spokesman B-PER I-PER said . But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry , established in May , appointing a new head to lead it . Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash . Accordingly , they demand an open investigation . A spokesman for B-ORG I-ORG Minister B-PER I-PER said the appointment of a new inquiry head , administrative law expert B-PER I-PER , showed the government 's commitment to pursue the matter . A report is due in May next year . One B-MISC diplomat has been prosecuted this year for having sex with a B-MISC boy under 16 but was acquitted . Police have investigated others .

But in February 1993 B-PER I-PER , was shot and killed after answering a knock at the door of his B-LOC home . " The inference from all the material is that the marauders had come to the wrong house , " Judge B-PER I-PER said . In sentencing B-PER , who pleaded guilty , B-PER took into account his " mildly retarded " intellectual state , which placed him in the lowest two percent of the population . B-PER said B-PER was " not only the victim of a horrendous crime , but his death was brought about in circumstances of an equally ghastly error on the part of the prisoner and his accomplices " .

" The negotiations will be held both in B-LOC and in B-LOC , " one source , speaking on condition of anonymity , told B-ORG . Another source said most of the key negotiators from both B-ORG and B-ORG had returned to B-LOC , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations . Both sources said B-ORG and B-ORG did not hold talks on Thursday with B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Secretary-General B-PER I-PER , who is coordinating the negotiations over the B-LOC find in B-LOC I-LOC . The first source also said B-ORG had until December 21 to submit to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG a feasibility study on the central region of the B-LOC property , estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold . The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by B-ORG to contain 57 million ounces of gold . " B-ORG is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline , " the source said . He said B-ORG would then formally seek the permission of the B-MISC government to begin construction to develop B-LOC 's central region , which might take up to two years . The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between B-ORG and B-ORG . " This is a huge project ... we are not selling furniture , and B-ORG has 13,000 shareholders to answer to , " the source said . " While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues , there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out , " he added . The source said no new deadline had been set by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for B-ORG and B-ORG to strike a deal . The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal , and advised B-ORG to take a 25 percent stake and B-ORG 75 percent to develop the property . " As far as I am aware , there 's been no new deadline , " the source said . The Ministry 's B-PER said on Thursday that both B-ORG and B-ORG had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the B-ORG gold property . The government also wants 10 percent of the property . B-PER said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies . He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement , the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the B-ORG find . B-ORG has a partnership deal with B-PER I-PER I-PER of the B-ORG I-ORG run by President B-PER 's eldest son , B-PER I-PER , under which B-PER would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake B-ORG 's richest parts . B-ORG has teamed up with a construction company in the B-ORG I-ORG of B-PER 's eldest daughter , B-PER I-PER I-PER , in what B-ORG had said was a partnership " to prepare us for a potential mining development project " . B-MISC I-MISC exceeds sales target .

A version with lower road clearance and front and rear spoilers accounted for two-thirds of the sales . FEATURE - B-LOC sees prestige in hosting B-ORG . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-LOC 's winning campaign to host the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said . " As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , B-LOC has a disproportionately large stake in the B-ORG , " said B-PER I-PER , economist at research house B-ORG . " B-LOC stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . " The city-state met B-LOC opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 . In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over B-LOC 's caning of an B-MISC teenager for vandalism , B-MISC Trade Representative B-PER I-PER had said the meeting ought to be held where the B-ORG was going to be headquartered . That would have meant B-LOC . But B-LOC had the support of other B-ORG members . B-PER I-PER I-PER , senior fellow at the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , said B-LOC 's hosting of the conference " carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . " There is the international prestige B-LOC would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said B-PER I-PER I-PER , head of Business Policy at the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the B-ORG and the implementation of the B-LOC Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) . In June , the B-ORG hailed B-LOC for its open market policies but the B-ORG I-ORG and other trading powers called on B-LOC to speed up the opening of its services sector . B-PER said the struggle that B-LOC had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks . " There is tension at every step of the way , " since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said . B-PER said hosting the meeting carried prestige for B-LOC , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . " From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for B-LOC 's tourism industry , B-PER said . A large part of B-LOC 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average B-MISC " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " B-PER said . " But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for B-LOC as a small economy . " B-PER said any political gains the B-LOC government would get from the B-ORG meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda . " If there are any movements toward freer trade , then B-LOC 's economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . " But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this . I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . " B-LOC B-ORG says hopes to start int'l business soon . B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said on Friday that it hopes to move into the international telecommunications business as soon as possible following the government 's decision to split B-ORG into three firms under a holding company . " We hope to start international telephone business as soon as possible , " a company official told B-ORG . The official said the latest government decision to split the company under a holding company would allow flexibility in B-ORG 's international phone business . Earlier , Posts and Telecommunications Minister B-PER I-PER told a news conference the government plans to split B-ORG into three firms under a holding company , but did not specify when the restructuring would likely take effect . One of the three new companies will be a long-distance operator and the other two will be local-call operators , B-PER said . One of the local firms will operate in west B-LOC and the other in east B-LOC , he added . The long-distance operator will offer international services , B-PER said . The B-ORG official said the timing of the planned split-up was uncertain because more discussions by government officials were required . B-ORG launches B-MISC food discount stores . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-12-06 B-MISC supermarkets group B-ORG I-ORG said on Friday it had launched a second food store format for B-MISC consumers today , opening 16 B-MISC food discount stores in B-LOC . The B-MISC stores are located in B-LOC 's capital B-LOC I-LOC and in the country 's second city B-LOC I-LOC . The discount price format store B-MISC is to complement B-ORG 's full service supermarket B-MISC , recently launched in B-LOC . " In the coming five to ten years , B-ORG plans to open many more stores of both formats , making B-MISC and B-MISC household names in the region , " B-ORG said in a statement .

B-ORG I-ORG - RETIRING B-PER WEIGHS UP OPTIONS . B-LOC 1996-12-07 B-PER I-PER will consider offers to play club rugby in B-LOC but looks more likely to spend the next year chasing business opportunities in B-LOC . The 34-year-old winger played his final game in a B-ORG jersey on Saturday but is currently a target for clubs eager to match B-LOC side B-ORG who have already snapped up B-PER I-PER , B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER . " If the opportunity is there I 'd obviously think about it but the thing that holds me back is business , " said B-PER . " I 'd like to come over but there are a lot of things happening at home . I 've also got a contract to play for B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in the Super 12 next year . " Former B-ORG captain B-PER I-PER believes B-PER may yet be tempted to B-LOC . " I 'm sure there are a few people in B-LOC who 'd be delighted to have B-PER I-PER in their club 's jersey , " he said . SOCCER - B-MISC PREMIER LEAGUE SUMMARIES .

B-PER I-PER I-PER opened the scoring for B-LOC I-LOC in only the fifth minute , turning unmarked on the penalty spot to fire a shot into the top corner . It looked like turning into a rout as B-PER I-PER I-PER rapidly added two more in the seventh and 15th minutes but although the B-MISC continued to dominate they failed to add to the score before the interval . But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up , B-PER I-PER I-PER heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute .

B-PER suffered a concussion and did not return to the game . " Mr B-PER left his feet to deliver a forearm blow to Mr B-PER as he was about to be checked legally by his opponent , " said B-ORG discipline chief B-PER I-PER in handing out the suspension . " Although it is clear from the videotape that Mr B-PER 's actions were a reaction to the impending hit and there was no intent to injure his opponent , there can be no excuse for this type of conduct , " B-PER said . B-PER , who is struggling with only nine goals and 12 assists in 26 games , will miss Saturday 's home game against B-ORG . BOXING - B-PER DEFEATS B-PER IN B-ORG HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT .

B-LOC 1996-12-07 B-PER I-PER 's relationship with the people of B-LOC was cemented on Saturday when the B-MISC was officially declared one of their own . B-PER , 61 , and his wife , B-PER , became citizens of B-LOC when they formally received B-MISC passports from deputy Prime Minister B-PER I-PER who said the honour had been made in recognition of B-PER 's achievements as the national soccer manager . " The years I spent as manager of the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC were the best years of my life . It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great , great friends in B-LOC . That is why this is so emotional a night for me , " B-PER said . " It was the joy that we all had over the period , that I shared with people that I grew to love , that I treasure most , " he added . B-PER managed B-LOC for 93 matches , during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995 . He guided B-LOC to two successive B-MISC I-MISC finals tournaments and to the 1988 B-MISC championship finals in B-LOC , after the B-MISC beat a well-fancied B-LOC team 1-0 in their group qualifier . The lanky former B-ORG I-ORG defender did not make his B-LOC debut until the age of 30 but eventually won 35 caps and was a key member of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC winning team with his younger brother , B-PER .
