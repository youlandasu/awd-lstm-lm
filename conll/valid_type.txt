CRICKET - B-ORG TAKE OVER AT TOP AFTER INNINGS VICTORY . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC I-MISC all-rounder B-PER I-PER took four for 38 on Friday as B-ORG beat B-ORG by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship . Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals B-ORG , B-ORG and B-ORG all closed in on victory while B-ORG made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against B-ORG . After bowling B-ORG out for 83 on the opening morning at B-LOC I-LOC , B-ORG extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with B-LOC discard B-PER I-PER taking three for 83 . Trailing by 213 , B-ORG got a solid start to their second innings before B-PER stepped in to bundle them out for 174 . B-ORG , however , look certain to regain their top spot after B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER gave them a firm grip on their match against B-ORG at B-LOC . B-PER , considered surplus to B-LOC 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as B-ORG reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 . By the close B-ORG had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner B-PER had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain . At the B-LOC , B-ORG captain B-PER I-PER , another man dumped by B-LOC , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against B-ORG . He was well backed by B-LOC hopeful B-PER I-PER who made 70 as B-ORG closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 . B-ORG kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing B-ORG to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat . B-MISC B-PER I-PER took six for 82 but B-PER I-PER , 123 , and B-PER I-PER , 109 , took B-ORG to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 . After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , B-ORG stepped up a gear to dismiss B-ORG for 214 . They were held up by a gritty 84 from B-PER I-PER but B-MISC fast bowler B-PER I-PER took four for 55 . By stumps B-ORG had reached 108 for three . CRICKET - B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC SCORES .

SOCCER - B-PER NAMED AS B-LOC CAPTAIN . B-LOC 1996-08-30 The world 's costliest footballer B-PER I-PER was named as the new B-LOC captain on Friday . The 26-year-old , who joined B-ORG for 15 million pounds sterling ( $ 23.4 million ) , takes over from B-PER I-PER , who led the side during the B-MISC championship in June , and former captain B-PER I-PER . B-PER and B-PER are both injured and will miss B-LOC 's opening B-MISC I-MISC qualifier against B-LOC on Sunday . B-PER takes the captaincy on a trial basis , but new coach B-PER I-PER said he saw no reason why the former B-ORG and B-ORG skipper should not make the post his own . " I 'm sure there wo n't be a problem , I 'm sure B-PER is the man for the job , " B-PER said . " There were three or four people who could have done it but when I spoke to B-PER he was up for it and really wanted it . " In four days it 's very difficult to come to a 100 percent conclusion about something like this ... but he knows how to conduct himself , his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front . " B-PER 's B-MISC I-MISC striking partner B-PER I-PER withdrew from the squad with an injury on Friday . He will probably be replaced by B-PER 's B-ORG team mate B-PER I-PER .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC boxing legend B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER climbs into the ring on Saturday in another age-defying attempt to sustain his long career . B-PER , 45 , takes on little-known B-MISC B-PER I-PER , 30 , in a super middleweight non-title bout in B-LOC I-LOC . The fight , B-PER 's first on home soil for 10 years , is being billed here as the " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " and B-PER still talks as if he was in his prime . " I want a fifth title . This match is to prepare me . I feel good . I 'm not retiring , " B-PER told B-ORG . But those close to the boxer acknowledge that the man who has won championships in four different weight classes -- lightweight , welterweight , junior middleweight and middleweight -- is drawing close to the end of his career . " Each time he fights , he 's on the last frontier of his career . If he loses Saturday , it could devalue his position as one of the world 's great boxers , " B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG President B-PER I-PER said . B-PER , whose 97-12 record spans three decades , hopes a win in the 10-round bout will earn him a rematch against B-LOC I-LOC 's B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER . B-PER took a controversial points decision against the B-MISC in B-LOC I-LOC in June in a title fight . SQUASH - B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC QUARTER-FINAL RESULTS .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 B-PER I-PER escaped disaster on Thursday but B-MISC finalist B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the B-MISC I-MISC . The 11th-seeded B-PER fell short of reprising his B-MISC miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard B-PER I-PER 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court . Next door on the grandstand , 10th seed B-PER lost to another player with a B-MISC connection -- bad boy B-PER I-PER . The temperamental left-hander defeated the B-MISC 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 . The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion B-PER had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole , winning 18 of the last 19 games against B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER . But the night belonged to the upstarts . B-PER , who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit , two sets down in the third set against B-PER I-PER in the B-MISC semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback . B-PER , a winner two weeks ago in B-LOC I-LOC for his first pro title , served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before B-PER came charging back . " I just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' " said the 26-year-old B-PER , ranked 65th . " I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that -- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home . " The hard-serving B-PER , a former B-LOC collegiate national champion , fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die B-PER . The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when B-PER , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give B-PER a 4-2 lead . The B-MISC blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when B-PER found the net with another backhand from 40-0 . " You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit . I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , " said B-PER . " But I think he served pretty well when he had to . " B-PER , whose B-MISC tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the B-ORG I-ORG , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , 24 minute tango with B-PER on the grandstand . A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted B-MISC and booed the lanky B-MISC , who ate up all the attention . " I 'm an emotional player , " said the 104th-ranked B-PER . " I think I played very well tonight , very focused . " The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the B-MISC won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators . " I love the crowd if they boo me every day . It fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , " B-PER said . " I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me . If tennis was like that every day , I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . " B-PER did not appreciate B-PER 's antics . " He 's always complaining too much , " said B-PER . " But I think it 's not that . I think I played really bad . It was tough to play at night . Balls were going really fast . I lost too many points that I never lose . I did n't play my tennis . " " I do n't see the ball like I see during the day . I play an B-MISC so that 's why I play at night . I did n't feel good on the court . " At the end of the match , B-PER blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd , then jiggled his body to a B-PER rooting section in a jeering salute . " I support their enthusiasm , " B-PER said about the fans . " At the same time , they 're cheering blatantly against me . After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle . " B-ORG B-MISC I-MISC B-PER RETIRES . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-PER I-PER , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's all-time leading rusher as a quarterback and one of the most athletic players ever to line up over centre , retired Thursday . B-PER played his entire 11-year career with the B-ORG I-ORG . A three-time B-MISC I-MISC selection , B-PER rushed for 4,482 yards on 677 carries . " I would like to thank the B-ORG organisation and the wonderful fans of B-ORG for supporting me throughout my career , " B-PER said . " Although it saddens me to leave , I am looking forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing other interests that have been on the back burner for sometime . " " B-PER was one of the most exciting quarterbacks in B-ORG history , " said B-ORG owner B-PER I-PER . " During his 11 years in B-LOC , B-PER was the cornerstone of the B-ORG ' franchise and brought many great moments to fans in B-LOC as well as across the B-ORG . " A second-round choice in 1985 , B-PER completed 1,874-of-3,362 passes ( 55.7 percent ) for 22,877 yards and 150 touchdowns . B-PER has already been signed as a broadcaster .

B-PER stood two strokes ahead of B-PER I-PER and three up on B-PER I-PER , B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER . B-PER , who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , almost eagled the 18th hole . He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace . " Yesterday was the toughest day I 've had for a long time , " B-PER said . " Today , I got to play golf . " He added : " I thought I got off off to a great start . It was a perfect start . I 'm in a good position . " B-PER , who called his round a " pleasant surprise , " finished with six birdies on the final eight holes . " We finally got things going in the right direction , " he said . " It was my best round in a very long time . My short game has improved since I 've had to use it so often . That 's always been the worst part of my game . All in all , playing bad 's been a good experience . " B-PER , who came within one shot of the course record set by B-PER I-PER during Wednesday 's pro-am , has three career B-MISC I-MISC victories , but none since the 1993 B-MISC I-MISC . B-PER , whose only win came at the 1994 B-MISC I-MISC and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the B-MISC I-MISC in January , eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place . " No bogeys on the card , " he noted . " Sometimes I take more pride in that . " B-PER was among a group of 13 players at four under , including 1993 champion B-PER I-PER , who tied for second at last week 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , and former B-MISC I-MISC champ B-PER I-PER . Defending champion B-PER I-PER shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back . B-PER I-PER , the only four-time winner on the B-MISC I-MISC , skipped the tournament after winning the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC last week . B-PER I-PER , B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER , who make up the rest of the top four on the money list , also took the week off . SOCCER - B-PER 'S `LOST PASSPORT ' EXCUSE NOT ENOUGH FOR B-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC first division team B-ORG I-ORG will be without key midfielder B-PER I-PER for Saturday 's game with B-ORG I-ORG after B-ORG , soccer 's world governing body , suspended the B-MISC for one game for missing his national side 's B-MISC tour . B-PER excused his absence from B-LOC 's game against B-LOC , on Wednesday , and Saturday 's match with the B-LOC by saying he had lost his passport . But that did not prevent him from collecting the one-match suspension . ATHLETICS - B-PER DEFEATS B-PER IN FRONT OF FORMER CHAMPIONS . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC B-PER I-PER outclassed B-MISC 100 metres champion B-PER I-PER for the third time at a major B-MISC meeting in front of the most experienced sprinting crowd in the world on Friday . Watched by an array of former B-MISC sprint champions at the B-LOC grand prix meeting , B-PER made a brilliant start in the 100 metres and held off B-PER 's strong finish to win in 10.08 seconds despite cool conditions . B-PER , who set a world record of 9.84 on his way to victory in B-LOC , could not catch his B-MISC rival and had to settle for third in a tight finish . B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER was second with 10.09 with B-PER finishing in 10.13 . Last Friday B-PER , who finished fourth at the B-MISC I-MISC , upstaged a trio of B-MISC champions including B-PER to win the 100 in B-LOC . Earlier this month he also beat world champion B-PER in B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC all belong to the most lucrative series in the sport , the B-MISC I-MISC . Among the crowd on Friday were B-MISC 100 metres champions going back to 1948 . They had been invited to the meeting to watch a special relay to mark the 60th anniversary of B-PER I-PER 's four gold medals at the 1936 B-MISC in the same B-LOC stadium . " Today the concentration was the most important thing for me , " B-PER said . Despite the coolish conditions B-MISC I-MISC champion B-PER I-PER looked in commanding form in the women 's 100 , clocking 10.89 to defeat B-MISC rival B-PER I-PER , who was second in 10.94 .

B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-ORG came down heavily on B-MISC club B-ORG I-ORG on Friday for " disgraceful behaviour " in an B-MISC final match against B-ORG of B-LOC . The B-MISC club were fined 25,000 B-MISC francs ( $ 20,850 ) for unsporting conduct and captain B-PER I-PER banned for seven games . He was sent off for insulting the referee and then urged his team mates to protest . B-PER I-PER will be sidelined for six B-MISC ties after pushing the referee in the back as he protested about a B-ORG goal , while B-PER I-PER was banned for four matches for a verbal attack soon after B-PER was also dismissed . B-ORG won the August 20 match 3-1 thanks to two late goals . They took the tie 3-2 on aggregate and qualified for the B-MISC I-MISC . ATHLETICS - B-PER , B-PER TO MEET IN B-LOC . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC champion B-PER I-PER and world record holder B-PER I-PER will both take part in a triple jump competition at the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC on September 9 . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Friday that a schedule reshuffle had allowed organisers to hold a men 's triple jump as well as the women 's long jump on the " one usable runway at the war-devastated " B-LOC stadium . B-MISC I-MISC silver medal winner B-PER has called on other leading athletes to take part in the B-LOC meeting -- a goodwill gesture towards B-LOC as it recovers from the war in the B-LOC -- two days after the grand prix final in B-LOC . B-PER was quoted as saying : " What type of character do we show by going to the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC in B-LOC where there is a lot of money to make but refusing to make the trip to B-LOC as a humanitarian gesture ? " SOCCER - B-PER TO COACH B-ORG . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-30 Former international goalkeeper B-PER I-PER is to coach struggling B-MISC first division side B-ORG , the club said on Friday . B-PER , who played for B-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , takes over from B-PER I-PER who was fired on Thursday after B-ORG 's home defeat to B-ORG 2-1 in the league . B-ORG have been unable to win any of their four league matches played this season and are lying a lowly 18th in the table . SOCCER - B-ORG 'S B-PER MOVES TO B-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-30 Former B-MISC international winger B-PER I-PER , transferred to B-ORG in 1992 for what was believed to be a world record sum , has been loaned to B-MISC I-MISC club B-ORG for a year , newspapers reported on Friday . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said the deal would cost B-ORG around $ 600,000 . B-PER , 27 , joined B-ORG from B-ORG in a $ 12 million deal that many have speculated involved far more money changing hands and which has subsequently been investigated by magistrates for alleged financial irregularities . The player suffered severe head injuries in a near-fatal car crash the following year and has since struggled to regain the form that made him a hero in B-LOC . The move to B-MISC B-ORG reunites B-PER , who fell out with B-MISC coach B-PER I-PER last season , with his former coach at B-ORG , B-PER I-PER . CRICKET - B-LOC I-LOC BEAT B-LOC BY FOUR WICKETS .

B-LOC B-ORG H1 PROFIT RISE BELOW TARGET . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC listed state engineer B-ORG said it almost doubled six-month output , with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei . But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports , keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei . B-ORG 's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995 , the company report to the B-LOC stock exchange showed . B-ORG , based in the central B-MISC town of B-LOC , manufactures water purification equipment , machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment . " In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products , " the report said . From January to June B-ORG exported 59 percent of its output , up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year . The company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits . Year-on-year inflation , initially estimated at 20 percent in December , was 33.8 percent in June , higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent . The 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in July . The leu currency has slipped only gradually this year , and is currently quoted at an official rate of 3,162 to the dollar , well below the 3,550 retail price that exporters say is more realistic . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG 40-1 3120264 B-MISC NBP REFRAINS FROM REVERSE REPO OPERATION .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 NYMEX refined product prices lingered at session lows amid slim volume before the close while crude experienced lackluster buying ahead of the B-LOC B-MISC I-MISC weekend , traders said . " There was some profit-taking early on , and it 's just sitting there , " a B-LOC trader said of heating oil 's and gasoline 's losses . September heating oil stood 1.02 cents lower at 62.65 cents a gallon . Heat hit a session low of 62.45 shortly before the close . September gasoline stood 0.87 cent lower at 62.85 cents a gallon . Friday 's low in September gasoline was 62.75 . Traders also said players were selling refined products in favor of crude ahead of the front month 's Friday expiry in the refined products . The October heating oil-to-crude crack spread narrowed to $ 4.22 a barrel from Thursday 's $ 4.58 while the October gasoline-to-crude spread narrowed to $ 3.60 from Thursday 's $ 3.86 a barrel . October crude stood eight cents higher at $ 22.23 barrel .

B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-LOC debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower , as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) index for the B-LOC area , traders and analysts said . The August B-LOC B-ORG rose 8.8 points to 60.0 , its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993 . Primary dealers immediately sold B-MISC and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July 's 51.2 . Traders also said B-MISC investors were unwinding long B-MISC futures / short swaps , and that heavy put buying helped pressure B-MISC to lower levels before the close . One B-LOC firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions , while a B-MISC firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads . " Even before the data came out , we were seeing put buying , " one floor trader said . Meanwhile , funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes . Rumors circulated that the B-ORG I-ORG was buying five-year notes , and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets . However , December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 , as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent , one analyst said . December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32 , even though conditions were slightly oversold , traders said . The December calendar spread continued to widen , also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation . While the market continues to price-in higher B-LOC interest rates , there was little conviction to the theory that the B-ORG I-ORG would tighten rates before the next B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG meeting on September 24 . B-ORG I-ORG governor B-PER I-PER , speaking on B-LOC cable television network B-ORG , said the B-LOC economy appears on balance to be a bit strong , adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check . Earlier in the day , B-ORG chairman B-PER I-PER said at the annual B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations . Traders said the B-ORG 's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July B-ORG meeting has cast more focus on every piece of B-LOC economic news . " The B-ORG 's stance has really sensitized us to all this data , " one analyst said . " The revisions to GDP , for example , may not have attracted a lot of attention . " At the end of pit trade , December bonds were off 27/32 at 106-25/32 , 10-year notes down 21/32 at 105-17/32 , munibonds off 17/32 at 111-20/32 , December B-MISC were down 11 bps at 93.94 , March B-MISC were off 13 bps at 93.72 and March T-bills were down 12 bps at 94.33 . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG shares rise on merger . B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC . 1996-08-30 Shares of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 Friday afternoon after Thursday 's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for $ 31 a share , or $ 135 million . B-ORG was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG has 4.45 million common shares outstanding , some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price . The acquisition will beef up B-ORG , B-MISC B-ORG 's B-MISC I-MISC car and truck seating business , allowing it to better compete with B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG . Family-controlled B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million , was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers , said B-PER I-PER , chief financial officer . " Unfortunately , in the auto industry these days , a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore , " B-PER said . " This merger makes us much more competitive . " He added that B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's top executives have been asked to stay on with B-ORG after the merger , though their future roles have not yet been defined . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers , which had reduced production at some important customers , but are now recovering , analysts said . The company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996 , up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million . B-ORG plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers -- those it deals with directly -- in half over the next five years . " The deal really levels the seating field somewhat , " said B-PER I-PER of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " It should give B-ORG the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market . " B-ORG 's traditional strength has been instrument panels , door panels and other interior components . B-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers , including seats , instrument panels , door panels carpeting and headliners . B-LOC meals / feeds follow B-LOC higher , trade slow . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-LOC meals and feeds sellers marked up high protein soymeal by around 1.50 stg a tonne on Friday following gains in B-LOC at Thursday 's close . Trade was very quiet with only one deal reported when spot high protein soymeal fetched 215 stg a tonne ex-store on the south coast . " I would n't get too excited about this one becuase I think it 's for all of five tonnes , which when you think about just about sums up the state of the market at the moment , " said a trader . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG +44 171 542 8062 B-MISC captors of B-MISC jet charged with hijack . B-LOC 1996-08-30 Seven B-MISC who seized a B-MISC airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to B-LOC were on Friday charged with hijack , ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in B-LOC . Police said the seven men , who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at B-LOC airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum , would appear in court on Saturday . The B-MISC claimed they were " ordinary people persecuted by the regime of B-PER ( B-PER ) " but B-ORG I-ORG officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered . Under B-MISC law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to B-LOC . The hijack began on Monday when an B-MISC plane was taken over shortly after it took off from B-LOC . The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in B-LOC unless they were taken to B-LOC . After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers ' surrender , police found only knives and fake explosives . Late bond market prices .

He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that .

The speaker of the B-LOC parliament , B-PER I-PER , told B-ORG that a draft constitution , due to be put to a national referendum on November 7 , would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler . " The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President B-PER , who leads this B-MISC state of 10 million people , is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution , " B-PER said . The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president . B-PER 's aides shrugged off B-PER 's charge . " If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this , " B-PER I-PER , B-PER 's political adviser , told B-ORG . " The people have asked us to establish order and that 's our main aim . " B-PER , 41 , won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order , fight corruption and repair the strong links with B-LOC that were disrupted by the collapse of the B-LOC I-LOC . But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents , trade unions and parliament and B-PER said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him . " This constitution , which has been prepared in secret , aims to gather all power in one man 's hands , " he said . " We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods , like this referendum . " B-PER signed a pact with B-LOC in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation . But nationalist groups , scared by the prospect of renewed B-LOC domination and B-LOC 's backing for B-PER , protested against the deal . B-PER responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact . The B-LOC I-LOC last week granted political asylum to two opposition leaders , B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER . B-MISC troops now control devastated town . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC government troops now control of the strategically vital town of B-LOC after driving out B-MISC rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby B-LOC mountains on Friday . The commander-in-chief of B-LOC 's armed forces , Major-General B-PER I-PER , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it . He said his troops took B-LOC without casualties on August 23 , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains . B-PER said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of B-LOC around the village of B-LOC . B-LOC , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the capital B-LOC , was in ruins . Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets . The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February . B-LOC , which borders B-LOC and B-LOC , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of B-MISC and liberal groups . Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky B-MISC I-MISC ceasefire . B-LOC is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children . Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it . " Help me , help me , " said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food . The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting . " We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , " said B-PER I-PER , a bearded elderly B-MISC in a long white shirt . Although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock . They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital . One elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in B-LOC and the other two had left to fight for the opposition . He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . " It 's not important who holds this town , we just need to stop the war , " he said .

" Until a new general manager of B-ORG is appointed ...

" These are powerful weapons , " a spokesman with the B-ORG I-ORG told B-ORG by telephone , adding that police had not ruled out a possible terrorist attack on the ornate B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC presidential palace in B-LOC 's historic downtown area . " They could cause serious damage as much as 500 meters ( yards ) away from wherever they were detonated , " the spokesman added . He said police backed by explosive experts were combing the area in search of other possible weapons or explosive devices . The police spokeman said plastic explosive like C-4 is not a normal component in claymore mines . But he said the eight mines seized by police had been " specially adapted . " The spokesman declined further comment , except to say that two women and a man identified as a lawyer had been arrested in connection with the landmines . Assault charges dropped against B-LOC ex-rebel . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-30 Flamboyant former B-MISC guerrilla leader B-PER I-PER walked free on Friday after charges of attempted murder were dropped , police said . B-PER had been in police custody for 10 days after B-PER I-PER , a B-MISC visitor from the B-LOC , accused B-PER of trying to kill him in a bar-room brawl in the mining town of B-LOC 56 miles ( 90 km ) east of B-LOC . B-PER , 35 , denied the charge and reached an agreement with B-PER after replacing a golden necklace lost in the scuffle . It was the second time B-PER had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years . In 1994 he served two months for shooting a thief in the backside . B-PER , who led a rebel group against the military regime of B-PER I-PER in the late 1980s , is now a successful businessman with mining and logging interests . B-MISC opposition newspaper editor pardoned . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 B-LOC 's King B-PER I-PER on Friday gave a royal pardon to an opposition newspaper editor who had alleged top-level corruption . B-PER I-PER , former editor of the B-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG I-ORG ) newspaper , stepped through the gates of the run-down B-MISC colonial-era B-LOC prison late Friday afternoon , following intervention on his behalf by King B-PER . The B-ORG I-ORG had on August 23 sent the opposition B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG steering committee member to jail after upholding rulings by the municipal and appeal courts that handed down a five million riels ( $ 2,000 ) fine and one year 's imprisonment . The judge overturned a decision to shut down B-PER I-PER 's newspaper . The editor was prosecuted following a May 1995 article alleging top-level corruption . B-PER promised an amnesty to B-PER I-PER , along with fellow B-ORG member and journalist B-PER I-PER , who was released after serving a week of a year-long jail term in June . Co-Premiers Prince B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER agreed earlier this week to the king 's request for an amnesty . B-LOC I-LOC Gold - Moribund market seen continuing . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 B-LOC I-LOC gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market 's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better . The B-MISC I-MISC gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week 's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter . B-LOC premiums for B-MISC kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco B-LOC prices , with B-MISC I-MISC and B-MISC premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce . B-LOC dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by B-MISC I-MISC traders , following the distress sales of recent months after the B-LOC government 's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade . " I was shocked to see these offers coming in again , though there 's been no indication of price or volume . I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the B-MISC start selling in force , " one dealer said . Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by B-MISC sources ahead of next year 's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums . Gold closed down at $ 387.00 / $ 387.50 an ounce in B-LOC I-LOC on Friday , versus B-LOC I-LOC 's $ 387.60 / $ 388 finish on Thursday . Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries . Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 - $ 389 an ounce range , dealers said , but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-October . " I still think we 'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of October , in a retracement of the $ 418 - $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year , " one said . Silver , basis the September contract on B-LOC I-LOC 's Comex market , was expected to find support at between $ 5.12 - $ 5.15 an ounce and meet resistance from $ 5.25 - $ 5.30 , they added . September silver closed up $ 0.004 in B-LOC I-LOC on Thursday at $ 5.255 an ounce . B-LOC decks out for coup celebrations . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC are dressing up their capital B-LOC for celebrations on Sunday of the 27th anniversary of the coup which brought B-PER I-PER to power . Green flags and banners praise the " great revolution " and promise defiance against B-ORG I-ORG sanctions imposed for B-LOC 's refusal to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a B-ORG I-ORG flight over B-LOC , B-LOC . " We have chosen the challenge because it is our only option , " proclaimed one banner on the road to B-LOC airport which serves only internal flights because of the sanctions . Huge stadium lights are directed at the city 's B-LOC I-LOC where makeshift stages await Sunday 's festivities . Three B-MISC leaders -- from B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC -- are expected to attend the celebrations marking September 1 , 1969 when a group of young army officers , led by a 27-year-old B-PER , deposed King B-PER I-PER . " The revolution has brought us great achievements ... We are comfortable the revolution has taken care of us , improved our lives and given us capabilites , " B-PER I-PER I-PER , 42 , told B-ORG as he came out of Friday prayers . But some B-MISC have begun to show their discontent in the country 's east , which has become a hotbed of militant violence . B-MISC diplomats and exiled opponents said B-PER 's airforce blasted in July rebel strongholds in the mountainous B-LOC I-LOC region . Travellers arriving in B-LOC say militants and police officers clash regularly in B-LOC . At least 20 people were killed in the capital in early July after bodyguards loyal to B-PER 's sons fired at spectators of a football match who were chanting subversive slogans . B-PER has dismissed any unrest as the work of foreigners , and last year deported thousands of B-MISC and B-MISC workers . Twilight zone for B-LOC I-LOC as political race heats up . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 For B-LOC I-LOC , this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone . President B-PER , B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth . Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties , which already includes the question of whether the B-ORG I-ORG will raise interest rates to cool economic growth . They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets . " The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if B-PER and B-PER start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , " said B-PER I-PER , chief investment officer at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG " That 's when B-LOC I-LOC will need to worry . " He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the " bidding " intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise . " I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . " This week , the market weighed B-PER 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion . B-PER proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls . B-PER claims B-PER 's plan would increase the deficit , while the B-LOC I-LOC said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan . The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset B-LOC I-LOC 's expectations that B-LOC will balance the budget . " The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , " said B-PER I-PER at the consulting firm B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . During the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won . B-PER I-PER 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the B-LOC I-LOC in 1984 , while B-MISC B-PER I-PER , who promised higher taxes , lost . B-PER I-PER became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and B-PER won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks . The trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince B-LOC I-LOC that the B-ORG 's 30-year bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade . B-PER said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election . The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent . The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits . But the market stalled this summer after the B-MISC I-MISC industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22 . " The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , " said B-PER . He said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that B-PER has sharply narrowed the gap with B-PER in the polls . B-PER said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the B-LOC scandal that would damage the B-PER . " Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , " B-PER said . Right now , B-LOC I-LOC is pondering the candidates . " We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , " B-PER said . On Friday , the B-MISC I-MISC index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 . For the week , it was down 106.53 points . The B-MISC composite index closed 3.53 points lower Friday at 1,141.50 . For the week , it was down 1.55 points . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's index of 500 stocks was off 5.41 points at 651.99 , down 15.03 points for the week . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG index was down 1.66 points at 559.68 , and was off 1.26 for the week . Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-30 Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the B-LOC in August , reports said Friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day . The B-ORG I-ORG said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected . Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months . A separate report from B-LOC area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July . A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing . While production and orders rose at B-LOC area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check . Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than B-ORG I-ORG policy-makers had wanted . " It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , " said economist B-PER I-PER of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC , B-LOC . The reports fanned worries on B-LOC I-LOC that the B-ORG , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running . The 30-year B-ORG fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday . The B-MISC I-MISC industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday . A third report from the B-ORG I-ORG , on July personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half . It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since January when they were flat . Economist B-PER I-PER of B-ORG I-ORG bank in B-LOC said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth . " The B-ORG ( B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , " B-PER said in a written comment . The policy-making B-ORG is to meet on Sept . 24 to plot interest-rate strategy . It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion . In an interview on the cable television network B-ORG Friday , B-ORG I-ORG Governor B-PER I-PER said there still were " mixed signals " about the economy 's direction . " I think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , " B-PER said . He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low " the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . " While July consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's August index of consumer sentiment , made available on Friday to paying subscribers , rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July . B-PER said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production . " The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , " she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the B-ORG considers to be non-inflationary . New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products . Orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June . Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June . B-MISC avocados not expected in B-LOC . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG officials said Friday that B-MISC avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental B-LOC I-LOC -- will not likely be entering B-LOC markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today . " The opportunity to import ( B-MISC avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , " said B-PER I-PER , senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary B-PER I-PER . " We could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , " said B-PER . " We probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next November . " The B-ORG I-ORG proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on B-MISC avocados . Under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the B-MISC produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February . The plan has raised a storm of protest from B-LOC avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in B-LOC . B-LOC growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ 1 billion B-LOC industry if potentially harmful B-MISC insects were brought into the country along with the avocados . B-MISC officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the B-LOC growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to B-MISC producers . Under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in B-LOC , B-LOC , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed . B-MISC growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the B-MISC and B-LOC agriculture agencies . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the B-ORG I-ORG last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in B-LOC and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue . The administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation . But B-LOC avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position . " From a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , " said B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC avocado group . Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under . " It 's a very complicated issue , " said the B-ORG I-ORG 's B-PER . " We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . " B-LOC Cardinal B-PER says has terminal cancer . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-LOC Cardinal B-PER I-PER , head of the second-largest B-LOC B-MISC I-MISC archdiocese , said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live . B-PER , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick . " On Wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver . I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , " a composed B-PER told a news conference . In 14 years as B-LOC 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy . " I have been assured that I still have some quality time left , " he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable . " It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody . Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith , " he said . " Death is a natural phenomenom . " He said he would " serve until the end " as cardinal . Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although B-PER 's case was caught early . Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues . He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches . He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy . The spare , soft-spoken son of an B-MISC stonecutter took over the B-LOC archdiocese , the nation 's second-largest after B-LOC I-LOC , with 2.3 million parishioners , in 1982 . Ironically , B-PER , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by B-PER during the 1970s . B-PER steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse . B-PER prayed with him before he died from B-MISC last year . B-PER , who became archbishop of B-LOC in 1972 , played an increasingly prominent role in the B-LOC church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops . This month , he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find " common ground " among B-MISC I-MISC . Previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a " seamless garment . " B-ORG I-ORG deal could spark more mergers . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-30 The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG by B-ORG I-ORG could spark a flurry of other mergers involving B-LOC banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations . " B-ORG just strolled into the B-LOC and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , " said B-PER I-PER , banking industry analyst at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " Whoever wants a big market position in the B-LOC has to come in and grab B-ORG or B-ORG . " B-MISC I-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive B-LOC franchise in size after B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC I-LOC , B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , with $ 9.32 billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower B-LOC , analysts added . " It focuses more attention on B-ORG , B-ORG and B-ORG , " said B-PER I-PER , analyst at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG is a $ 9.33 billion B-MISC I-MISC B-MISC based thrift . " Now ... the most coveted bank out there is B-ORG , " B-PER said . B-ORG and B-ORG did not return phone calls seeking comment . Among those seen as having an interest in buying in B-LOC are B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG , B-MISC B-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC . Representatives of B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions . B-ORG , contacted by phone , would not comment . With a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets , B-ORG I-ORG was the prize in B-LOC , where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute . " B-ORG I-ORG was the plum of B-LOC and was the plum of the central B-LOC , " B-PER said . Talk that the B-LOC banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner . But B-ORG 's bid , representing a premium of 40 percent for B-ORG I-ORG stock , was large enough to get the deal done . " I think B-ORG I-ORG was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , " B-PER said . But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium . They also questioned whether B-ORG can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for B-ORG I-ORG . " I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium B-ORG put on this deal here , I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , " said B-PER I-PER , analyst at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC tight-lipped on B-LOC 's award to B-PER . B-LOC 1996-08-30 The B-ORG I-ORG refused to speculate on Friday on what might happen in the case of B-PER I-PER , the B-LOC black leader who was awarded a $ 250,000 human rights prize by B-LOC . " I 'm not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case , " B-ORG I-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER said . " ... The view of the B-LOC government on ( B-PER 's ) not accepting any gifts from B-LOC is well-known . " B-PER also noted : " We 've talked about the passport restriction for travel to B-LOC " but he did not elaborate . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG on Wednesday denied B-PER 's application to receive the $ 250,000 award or a $ 1 billion donation B-MISC leader B-PER I-PER had pledged to B-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG group after they met last January . B-PER organised last October 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC that brought thousands of black men to B-LOC for a peaceful rally . The B-ORG I-ORG said B-LOC was on the B-LOC list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that B-LOC has refused to hand over two B-MISC suspects in the 1988 bombing of B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC over B-LOC , B-LOC . That refusal led to the imposition of B-ORG sanctions on B-LOC . B-LOC I-LOC rig down by one to 162 in week . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 There were 162 rigs under contract in the B-LOC I-LOC as of August 30 , down one from the prior week , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said . The utilization rate for rigs working in the B-LOC , based on a total fleet of 181 , was 89.5 percent . The number of working rigs in B-MISC / B-MISC remained unchanged this week , with 105 rigs under contract out of a total fleet of 105 , a utilization rate of 100 percent . The worldwide rig count fell by one to 554 out of a total fleet of 608 , making the utilization rate 91.1 percent . -- B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 212-859-1620 B-PER team seeking to pin down debate details . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-30 Now that the party conventions are over , B-MISC have signalled they are ready to move into the next phase of the campaign and meet with President B-PER 's aides to hammer out details of presidential debates . The B-PER campaign released a letter Friday inviting their B-PER counterparts to meet with B-PER campaign manager B-PER I-PER to discuss particulars of the televised debates . " Next week , a small group of representatives from each of our campaigns should meet to address participants , format , timing and logistical issues surrounding the debates , " B-PER campaign manager B-PER I-PER wrote to B-PER campaign manager B-PER I-PER . Tentative dates for the debates are Sept . 25 , Oct. 9 and Oct. 16 . The vice presidential debate is scheduled for Oct. 2 . Former B-LOC I-LOC Gov . B-PER I-PER , who was on B-PER 's vice presidential short list before B-PER decided on B-PER I-PER , will head B-PER 's team . A decision is expected by mid-September on whether B-LOC billionaire B-PER I-PER , the B-ORG I-ORG candidate , will be allowed to participate in the debates , which are sponsored by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a non-profit , non-partisan organisation that took over the forums in 1988 from the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . B-MISC recovery mission is scrapped . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 Equipment problems and mechanical failure forced a recovery expedition to give up efforts to retrieve a giant slab of the B-MISC I-MISC from the ocean floor , a spokeswoman said on Friday . A 20-ton piece of the B-MISC 's steel hull , which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of B-LOC , B-LOC , fell back to the bottom of the sea , said B-PER I-PER of B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG that represents two of the ships used in the expedition . The piece of hull , lifted from the ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags , had been stuck about 200 feet ( about 70 metres ) below the water 's surface before it fell , she said . It fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped , she said . The steel-hulled B-MISC , thought to be unsinkable , struck an iceberg on April 14 , 1912 , and sank , killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board . The wreck was located in 1985 . Passengers who had paid $ 1,500 and up to accompany the recovery expedition on two cruise ships had returned back to port on Thursday , B-PER said . B-LOC appeals for B-LOC I-LOC peace . B-LOC 1996-08-30 The B-MISC government urged B-MISC and B-MISC on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC announced this week the expansion of B-MISC B-LOC I-LOC settlements surrounding B-LOC and the demolition of an B-MISC community centre in B-LOC I-LOC . City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally . But B-MISC President B-PER I-PER said the moves by Prime Minister B-PER I-PER 's government were tantamount to war . Tension has been rising in the region since . " We believe that the B-MISC settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace , " B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER said . " All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult , " he said , as news came of a renewed breakdown in B-MISC peace talks in B-LOC . B-PER told reporters B-LOC supported B-ORG I-ORG efforts to persuade B-LOC to stop further B-MISC settlement on the B-LOC I-LOC . The foreign ministry later announced B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER would visit B-LOC for talks with his B-MISC counterpart B-PER I-PER next month . The ministry said B-PER and B-PER would discuss the B-LOC I-LOC process and B-MISC relations at their meeting on September 9 . B-PER 's visit would be the first by an B-MISC cabinet minister since B-PER 's conservative government took power in une this year , the ministry said . Before B-PER 's arrival in B-LOC , B-MISC Defence Minister B-PER I-PER will visit B-LOC from September 2 to 4 , the defence ministry said . B-PER planned to meet his B-MISC counterpart B-PER I-PER and B-MISC President B-PER I-PER , the ministry said . He was also expected to meet Prime Minister B-PER and opposition leader B-PER I-PER for talks . B-LOC expels B-MISC , B-ORG I-ORG unions protest . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-LOC on Friday expelled another B-MISC man seized in a police raid on a B-LOC church as about 100 B-ORG I-ORG workers denounced " charters of shame " used to fly illegal immigrants home . A B-MISC man , detained in a round-up in the B-LOC church a week ago , was deported on a scheduled B-ORG I-ORG flight to B-LOC after his appeals failed , a spokesman for B-ORG I-ORG 's pro-Socialist B-ORG union said . He was apparently the eighth B-MISC deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits , unions said . Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention . About 100 people from the B-ORG and the B-MISC B-ORG unions marched outside B-ORG I-ORG headquarters at B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC airport north of B-LOC against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants . " We must obtain a formal commitment from ( B-ORG I-ORG chairman ) B-PER I-PER that no plane , no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame , " B-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER said . He said civilians should not be police accomplices . Twenty-three out of 25 charters flying illegal immigrants home since Prime Minister B-PER I-PER 's government took office in May 1995 have been civilian jets . The other two were military jets . Separately , B-PER confirmed the conservative government was preparing to submit a draft bill to parliament to tighten laws on illegal workers as part of a crackdown on immigration . " Legislation is insufficient in several areas , notably in those concerning illegal work , " B-PER told reporters . B-MISC police probe sex link in child kidnap case . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC police searching for a missing 10-year-old schoolgirl said on Friday the prime suspects in the case may have been involved in running a child prostitution ring . Police suspect B-PER I-PER 's aunt and a male companion abducted the girl and took her to the B-LOC . She was last seen being collected by the pair from school in B-LOC near B-LOC on Monday .

The list was being studied for possible links to previous child kidnappings and prostitution , a prosecutors ' spokesman told B-ORG . Missing B-MISC girl found alive at B-MISC campsite . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC police said on Friday they had found missing B-MISC girl B-PER I-PER alive on a campsite in the northern city of B-LOC and had arrested her aunt and companion on charges of kidnapping . " We have found B-PER on a campsite in B-LOC thanks to tipoffs from the B-MISC public . We have also found and arrested her aunt and companion , " said a spokeswoman of the B-MISC criminal investigation service . Police could not yet tell whether the 10-year-old showed any signs of sexual abuse . " We do n't know yet . It 's too early to tell , " she said . The girl was abducted from her school in B-LOC near B-LOC on Monday . B-MISC police suspected her aunt , 47 , and companion , 28 , were involved in running a child prostitution ring . Public prosecutors said they had found a list of children 's names and ages at the couple 's flat . The list was being studied for possible links to previous child kidnappings and prostitution , a prosecutors ' spokesman said . The couple would probably be extradited to B-LOC which has requested their deportation , the B-MISC police spokeswoman said . Descriptions of the couple 's car released to B-MISC media led to their arrest , she added . B-MISC copper falls , state firm may cut rates .

B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-LOC on Friday condemned B-LOC 's settlement policy and said Prime Minister B-PER I-PER was preparing for war with B-MISC . " Practices of the B-MISC government , especially its settlement activities , came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the B-MISC cause , " state-run B-ORG I-ORG said in a commentary . " When this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart , this means that it is preparing for war , " the radio said . B-MISC President B-PER I-PER described this week the decision to expand settlements in the B-LOC I-LOC as a declaration of war . B-MISC in the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the B-MISC move . The radio urged B-MISC to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the right-wing B-MISC government . " B-LOC could not confront a united B-MISC stand or usurp their rights because the B-MISC rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity , " B-LOC radio said . It welcomed the international criticism of B-LOC 's settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the B-MISC government to abandon this policy . " It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent B-LOC from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success , " the radio said . B-LOC and B-MISC have been dismayed by B-PER 's refusal to trade the occupied B-MISC lands for peace , his support for the expansion of settlements and his insistance on B-LOC as a unifed capital for B-LOC . B-LOC has held sporadic peace talks with B-LOC since 1991 without achieving a breakthrough . B-LOC police detain 26 suspected B-MISC militants . B-LOC 1996-08-30 Police have detained 26 suspected members of B-LOC 's largest militant group B-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG I-ORG ) , government newspapers reported on Friday . They said police arrested the militants in the eastern B-LOC province after capturing their leader B-PER I-PER in a satellite city outside B-LOC . B-ORG newspapers said the men had been plotting against " strategic institutions and prominent individuals " but gave no other details . The newspapers said the men were being interrogated . State security officials were not immediately available for comment . More than 960 people have been killed in the armed struggle the B-MISC launched in 1992 to topple President B-PER I-PER 's government and establish a purist B-MISC state in its place B-LOC blocks B-MISC pilgrims ' progress . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 B-PER I-PER did n't have a prayer . An B-MISC roadblock stopped the 38-year-old B-MISC from answering B-PER I-PER 's call to worship at B-LOC 's B-LOC mosque on Friday . " Go home . There are no prayers today , " an B-MISC soldier yelled at B-PER in B-MISC . B-MISC President B-PER , attacking B-LOC 's decision to expand B-MISC settlements and its policy on B-LOC , went before the B-MISC legislature on Wednesday to urge the two million B-MISC in the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC to go to the holy city . Pilgrims stood little chance of making progress . B-MISC have been banned by B-LOC from travelling from the B-LOC I-LOC to B-LOC since suicide bombings by B-MISC militants killed 59 people in the B-MISC state in February and March . And B-MISC checkpoints have circled B-LOC since 1993 , a concrete and constant reminder of B-LOC 's hold on a city it considers its eternal capital . The B-ORG wants B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC as the capital of a future B-MISC state . Only a few B-MISC trickled to the roadblocks . They were immediately turned back . " I am heeding B-PER I-PER 's ( B-PER 's ) call to pray at B-LOC and I came . It is our duty towards B-LOC to come and pray , " B-PER said . A tourist from B-LOC was also told by B-MISC soldiers at the B-LOC checkpoint that he could not enter B-LOC . " We have a peace treaty with them and we let them go wherever they want when they come to B-LOC , " said the tourist , B-PER I-PER , 37 . " I feel terrible . I am entitled to see B-LOC , " he said . Some B-MISC took to back roads , only to run into waiting B-MISC security forces . " The B-MISC have no right to prevent us from going to pray . What kind of peace is this that prevents us from reaching our holy places ? " asked B-PER I-PER , a 27-year-old B-LOC I-LOC labourer turned around by a police patrol on a back road . " B-PER I-PER ( B-PER ) is right . We have signed a peace treaty with the B-MISC but on the ground , we see that nothing has changed , " said 20-year-old B-PER I-PER from B-LOC refugee camp .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-30 Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the B-ORG I-ORG said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months . Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat . Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks . The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June . " In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , " B-ORG said . But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July . That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved . The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected . At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by B-LOC factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories . Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by B-LOC I-LOC economists . That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders . Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks . In addition , the B-ORG I-ORG 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth . It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June . Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity . Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June . But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion . Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion . World Markets Overnight Summary - Aug 30 .

The dollar rose slightly against the B-MISC mark , but edged lower against the B-MISC yen . The B-MISC I-MISC industrial average ended down 64.73 points at 5,647.65 , its largest drop since July 15 , when it closed with a loss of 161 points . In the broader market , declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . In the bond market , the 30-year B-ORG bond fell 23/32 of a point , or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond , raising its yield to 7.04 percent -- the highest since July 31 -- from 6.98 percent at Wednesday 's close . " Seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities , " said B-PER I-PER , chief technical analyst at B-PER I-PER . " We could carry another 100 points lower in the B-MISC , " he said . " I 'm telling clients things are dicey going into next Friday ( Sept . 6 ) so let 's be careful . " B-LOC I-LOC on Sept . 6 faces the key monthly employment report , which has been known to cause dramatic swings in stock prices . " We had two very strong economic reports , " said B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ' chief equity strategist . " There are more worries in bond land . Fears of a B-ORG tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July . " The B-ORG I-ORG reported that the nation 's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago . In another report , sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months , driving prices up in a strong housing market . Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February , when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year . Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President B-PER 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning . B-PER I-PER , who is credited with resurrecting B-PER 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre , quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute , with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents . Analysts said B-LOC I-LOC had grown accustomed to a moderate B-MISC in the form of B-MISC President B-PER . B-PER ' departure raised fears that B-PER would veer more to the left in a second term . The dollar closed at 1.4772 marks , up from 1.4767 late Wednesday . The dollar slipped to 108.40 yen from 108.45 . Oil markets rose sharply on a combination of low stocks , two hurricanes and allegations of illicit trading by B-LOC . September heating oil on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG closed 1.63 cents higher at 63.67 cents a gallon , September unleaded gasoline finished 1.39 cents up at 63.72 cents a gallon and October crude rose 44 cents to $ 22.15 a barrel . December cotton closed 0.95 cent higher at 77.06 cents per pound on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG despite some easing of concern about the twin hurricane threat to key B-LOC growing areas with forecasts indicating both storms may remain offshore . Overseas , B-LOC 's B-MISC I-MISC index had earlier climbed to 3,8921.1 just below its record of 3,922.1 , before edging down through the afternoon session to finish the day at 3,885.0 , a fall of 33.7 points . In B-LOC , the key 225-share B-MISC average shed 156.65 points , or 0.76 percent , to end at 20,553.16 . B-ORG cables look to tap B-MISC growth . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC tyre and cables giant B-ORG on Friday announced its long-awaited move into B-LOC with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing B-MISC telecommunications market . B-ORG is linking with B-MISC I-MISC group B-ORG I-ORG in a venture to be called the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in B-LOC , B-LOC province , B-LOC . The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at B-LOC to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years . The move marks a further move by B-ORG 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing B-MISC I-MISC developing markets with the group already present in B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . " This is really positive news for B-ORG , and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial B-MISC companies , " said analyst B-PER I-PER at B-ORG . She emphasised that the move was positive because B-ORG will have management control of the B-MISC venture , and it also showed another example of B-ORG exporting its technical know-how to developing markets . B-ORG shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected . The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 B-MISC in an easier B-LOC stock market . This will be B-ORG 's first industrial involvement in a B-MISC market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables . B-LOC 's second largest telecoms operator B-ORG already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks . " The starting of this production base in B-LOC has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in B-LOC , " said B-ORG I-ORG chairman and chief executive officer B-PER I-PER I-PER . B-ORG I-ORG has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the B-LOC , B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC . B-ORG I-ORG is a major B-MISC I-MISC company focusing on infrastruture , trading , distribution and property , with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms . It has investments in several industrial joint ventures in B-LOC . B-MISC bond futures revival delayed - B-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-30 A broad attempt to spur activity in B-MISC bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said on Friday . Market-making in the rarely-traded B-ORG contract was expected to begin today , but an B-ORG spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system . " It 's not ready yet . We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start , " B-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER I-PER told B-ORG . He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10-year contract , but the B-ORG had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks . Investors in B-MISC bonds currently use B-MISC bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the B-ORG contract is so illiquid . A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed . -- B-LOC newsroom +31 20 504 5000 , Fax +31 20 504 5040 B-ORG defends record over B-LOC peace mission . B-LOC 1996-08-30 The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by pro-Moscow leaders in breakway B-LOC and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region . B-PER I-PER , the chairman of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , told B-MISC radio the B-MISC body viewed the conflict in B-LOC as an internal B-MISC problem . " The B-ORG is completely involved . But one must not forget that the B-ORG only has limited powers there , " said Cotti , who is also the B-MISC foreign minister . " Our mission in B-LOC has done all it can within the given limitations . " B-MISC leaders in B-LOC have criticised B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC diplomat who heads the B-ORG B-LOC mission , saying he was biased toward B-PER I-PER , president of the self-declared separatist government . B-MISC peacemaker B-PER I-PER and B-MISC separatist military leader B-PER I-PER started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region . B-PER said B-LOC must remain part of B-LOC , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within B-LOC 's borders . " There is no doubt that B-LOC , according to B-ORG principles , belongs to a state called B-LOC , " he said , pointing out that B-LOC was an B-ORG member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty . He added that the B-ORG was the only international body which has been allowed into the B-LOC to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a " internal issue " . " We have a small concept , the details of which have yet to be worked out . B-LOC must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of B-MISC integrity , " said B-PER . B-MISC say no reason to reopen B-ORG I-ORG carqo enquiry . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 The B-MISC transport minister B-PER I-PER told the country ' second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the 1992 crash of an B-ORG I-ORG freighter which left 43 dead in an B-LOC suburb . She said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft 's waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by B-ORG I-ORG 's head office in B-LOC I-LOC . The B-MISC transport ministry had come in for pressure from a cross-section of B-MISC members of parliaments in May this year , some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted , dangerous goods . Others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight . B-PER said the latest evidence from B-ORG I-ORG in no way supported the allegations , and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident . -- B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017 B-MISC , B-MISC hold peace talks in B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-30 Representatives from B-LOC and B-LOC held talks earlier this week in B-LOC on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed B-LOC region , a diplomatic source close to the talks said on Friday . The source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said B-PER presidential adviser B-PER I-PER and his B-MISC counterpart B-PER I-PER met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home . An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in B-LOC , which represents around 20 percent of B-MISC territory , since May 1994 after ethnic B-MISC drove B-MISC out of the region . The conflict , which began in 1988 , claimed over 10,000 lives . " The main subject ( of the talks ) was the search for a peaceful solution for B-LOC , " the source said . He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in B-LOC . B-LOC has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to B-LOC if Armenian forces pull out , but will not accept B-LOC 's demands for the independence of the enclave . B-LOC 's B-ORG news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in B-LOC , adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last December in B-LOC . B-ORG said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) and the broad-based B-ORG I-ORG of countries led by B-LOC and B-LOC . Sombre mood on B-MISC island after plane crash . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-30 The windblown , chilly streets of this tiny B-MISC town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky . B-LOC is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered . Disaster struck on Thursday when a B-MISC airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all 141 people on board . " It 's a sight I will never forget . I will remember it for the rest of my life , " said B-PER I-PER . He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors . The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the B-MISC island of B-LOC on Thursday , just east of B-LOC . " Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board . Think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , " B-LOC , 29 , told B-ORG . Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses . The dead were all B-MISC and B-MISC , coming to work in the mining towns of B-LOC and B-LOC . B-LOC is a B-MISC settlement of just over 1,000 people , but it also feels the loss keenly . " I have trouble finding the words to express my grief . It 's a tragedy for everyone . We know many of the people who live in B-LOC , some of them could have been on the plane , " said B-PER I-PER , 52 . B-PER , a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years , said the B-MISC and B-MISC communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter . Teenage shop assistant B-PER I-PER was blunter . " I 'm glad it was not a B-MISC plane , " she said . " Just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die . They must be having a tough time of it now . " B-LOC , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from B-LOC , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away . Around 100 B-MISC and B-MISC miners were waiting in B-LOC to fly home on the plane that crashed . They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport . Another plane had been sent from B-LOC to pick them up . At this time of year , the only colour in B-LOC comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses . Everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden . Winter is in the air . B-LOC is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new B-LOC . B-LOC lies some 500 miles ( 800 km ) off the northern tip of B-LOC and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet . Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total , it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months . The terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks . B-LOC rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there . Only B-LOC has chosen to do so . B-ORG says wins 1.2 bln SKR B-LOC order . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC telecoms group B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Friday it won an order worth 1.2 billion crowns for a fixed public telecoms network in the B-LOC province of B-LOC . B-ORG said in a statement the order was from the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . The order included B-MISC switching equipment , ISDN equipment , B-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) products , broad-band multi-media communication network products , services and training , B-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . Deliveries are due to be completed by 1999 , the company said . -- B-LOC newsroom +46-8-700 1017 B-LOC has infrastructure in place for post-97 - B-PER . B-LOC 1996-08-30 B-LOC I-LOC Financial Secretary B-PER I-PER said on Friday that the territory had the " infrastructural hardware " to make a success of its future under B-MISC sovereignty from mid-1997 . " We have the largest and most efficient port on the B-LOC I-LOC coast ; we have the best transport and telecommunications infrastructure in the world ; and we are investing in this hardware on an enormous scale , " B-PER said in a speech to B-LOC during a visit to B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC I-LOC also had the necessary " constitutional infrastructure " in place , with the promise of autonomy in running its affairs after the handover from B-LOC to B-LOC . " What this means in practice is that B-LOC I-LOC will go on raising its own taxes , issuing its own currency , setting its own expenditure priorities and managing its own enormous financial reserves , " B-PER said . He acknowledged that many B-LOC I-LOC people had decided to seek their future elsewhere and others were sure to follow in the next nine months . " But for the great majority of us , B-LOC I-LOC is our home and B-LOC I-LOC 's future is our future . " -- B-LOC newsroom 64 4 473-4746 PRESS DIGEST - B-MISC newspapers - August 30 .

B-PER I-PER , 24 , was arrested in 1995 when he was found with 11 slabs of cannabis weighing 2.2 kg ( 4.8 pounds ) , the B-ORG said . B-LOC has a mandatory death sentence for anyone over 18 years of age found guilty of trafficking in more than 15 grams ( half an ounce ) of heroin , 30 grams ( an ounce ) of morphine or 500 grams ( 18 oz ) of cannabis or marijuana . Of the nearly 270 people hanged for various crimes in B-LOC since 1975 , almost half have been for drug-related charges . B-PER goes to B-LOC ahead of cabinet meeting . B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 B-MISC President B-PER I-PER arrived in the B-LOC I-LOC self-rule enclave of B-LOC from B-LOC on Friday , witnesses said . His aides said B-PER would hold the weekly meeting of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's cabinet in B-LOC on Saturday . In B-LOC , B-MISC security forces were bracing for thousands of B-MISC expected to answer B-PER 's call earlier this week to come to the city holy to B-MISC , B-MISC and B-MISC to pray in protest against B-LOC 's settlement policy in the B-LOC I-LOC and delay in peace negotiations . B-MISC want B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC as the capital of a future independent state . B-LOC , which captured and annexed B-LOC I-LOC in 1967 , says it will never cede any part of the city . B-PER , who made an interim peace deal with B-LOC in 1993 that set up self-rule , says he will only visit B-LOC once B-MISC occupation has ended . B-ORG I-ORG concerned about B-MISC bulldozers . B-ORG I-ORG 1996-08-29 B-ORG I-ORG members expressed concern on Thursday that B-LOC 's bulldozing of a B-MISC day-care centre for the disabled might further injure the B-LOC I-LOC peace process . Responding to a letter from the the B-MISC B-ORG observer mission , B-ORG I-ORG President B-PER I-PER of B-LOC said that members asked him to convey their views to B-LOC 's charge d'affaires , B-PER I-PER . " The members expressed their concern about the maintenance of the peace process and they urged that no action be taken that would have a negative impact on the negotiations , " B-PER said after an informal council session . " They asked me to call in the B-MISC charge d'affaires and discuss the matter with him , " he added . The B-MISC letter from B-PER I-PER said the destruction of the B-LOC centre was an effort by B-LOC to " alter the character , demographic composition and status of the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC " and violated agreements between B-LOC and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " This most recent measure represents a revival of old , malicious plans to confiscate the land and build units for B-MISC settlers within the walls of the B-LOC I-LOC . " " We expect the international community to take a clear and firm position , based on international law and in accordance with B-ORG resolutions , against all such B-MISC violations and illegal practices , " he said . On Tuesday , B-MISC crews hoisted a bulldozer over the walls of B-LOC 's old city and demolished the centre , saying it was being restored without a building permit . B-LOC had recently donated $ 30 million to the centre , called the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC . SOCCER - B-ORG SCRAPE 1-1 DRAW IN SCRAPPY OPENING MATCH . B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-31 A late goal by newly-signed defender B-PER I-PER saved the blushes of B-ORG I-ORG coach B-PER I-PER and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the B-MISC championship on Saturday . The B-MISC 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn B-ORG a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders B-ORG I-ORG . B-ORG started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former B-ORG playmaker B-PER I-PER headed home a corner after a flick-on by B-MISC B-MISC international midfielder B-PER . B-ORG looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when B-PER I-PER was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes . But B-ORG were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when B-PER I-PER was sent off 15 minutes from time . Shortly afterwards B-PER I-PER found space in the home defence and equalised for B-ORG with a shot that was deflected past despairing B-ORG ' keeper B-PER I-PER . In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and B-PER , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of B-ORG players at a free kick . Before the match B-ORG chairman B-PER I-PER said he would ignore a B-ORG decision banning B-MISC midfielder B-PER I-PER from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of B-LOC . In the event , coach B-PER I-PER decided not to use B-PER , who had claimed he did not join the B-LOC squad because he had lost his passport . B-MISC I-MISC - B-ORG BEAT B-ORG 42-36 IN SEMIFINAL .

B-PER added his second and B-LOC 's fifth just after the hour to complete the rout and give the B-MISC their biggest-ever away win .

But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half B-PER I-PER who missed five out of eight kicks at goal . Recalled fly-half B-PER I-PER kicked the B-ORG into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see B-PER I-PER launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap . B-PER missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the B-ORG who looked the more dangerous . Their promise was realised when B-PER made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger B-PER I-PER appeared to knock on B-PER 's reverse pass , B-MISC referee B-PER I-PER allowed B-PER I-PER I-PER to pick up and score under the posts . B-PER converted and B-PER kicked a penalty before B-ORG I-ORG hooker B-PER I-PER scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback . Instead B-PER kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the B-ORG ' second try . A quick penalty from B-PER I-PER I-PER five metres from the B-ORG I-ORG line set up the third try for B-PER five minutes later and when B-PER kicked his third penalty the B-ORG held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter . When the B-ORG I-ORG did break through , it was too late . Centre B-PER I-PER followed up B-PER ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half B-PER I-PER forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-31 Controversial B-MISC B-PER I-PER called B-PER I-PER a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC semifinals on Saturday . The match boiled over when B-PER made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third . When the referee called B-PER 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , B-PER shrieked at the B-MISC : " You cheat . " " He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat , " said B-PER , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour . " He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that . " B-PER won the game on the next point and said later that B-PER was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision . The B-MISC had upset B-PER 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8 . " I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled , " he added . He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end . I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it -- that 's Jansher . " B-PER said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat . " What he did was bad for squash , bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors . " We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that . " I think the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG should look into this matter and deal with it properly . I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action . " B-PER , bidding for an eighth B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC title , plays second-seeded B-MISC B-PER I-PER in the final . B-PER played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded B-PER I-PER of B-LOC 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4 . B-PER , who defeated B-PER in the semifinals of the B-MISC I-MISC in 1993 , said that he would like to win for the good of the game . " I have nothing against B-PER but it will be great if I could beat him , " said B-PER . " My biggest problem against B-PER is concentration . I want to beat him so badly that I just cannot get it together . " SQUASH - B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC SEMIFINAL RESULTS .

B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-PER I-PER of B-LOC fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 Saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . B-PER , who is seeking his first B-MISC I-MISC victory , moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament . B-PER tied the 18-hole record set by B-PER I-PER in 1994 at the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC and also equalled Saturday by B-PER I-PER . B-PER I-PER , who led by two strokes entering the third round , carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195 . He is striving for his fourth career B-MISC I-MISC victory and first since the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . B-PER I-PER , who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional , shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament . The 20-year-old B-PER , who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , struggled on the front nine , bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four , 359-yard ninth hole . After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round , he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18 . After B-PER started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second , the B-MISC birdied six of the next seven holes . B-PER continued to storm through the course , birdying three holes on the back nine , including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes . " I ca n't remember when I 've putted this well , " said B-PER . " I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in . " My game feels very good . I 've been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight . Whenever everyone 's making birdies , you never want to be even par . " B-PER had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes , including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole . " I did n't hit it very well today , " said B-PER . " B-PER blew right by me . Once he did , I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up . I made some really good pars . I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon . " Right now , I ca n't put my finger on what 's wrong . " B-PER I-PER shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under . B-PER I-PER , who tied for second at last week 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , and B-PER I-PER were both five shots off the lead at 14 under . B-PER I-PER , who also tied for second at the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under , including B-PER . The top four on the B-MISC I-MISC money list all skipped the tournament . TENNIS - B-LOC , B-LOC TEAMS OPEN ON ROAD FOR B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-31 This year 's B-MISC I-MISC finalists -- defending champion B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC -- will hit the road to open the 1997 women 's international team competition , based on the draw conducted Saturday at the B-MISC I-MISC . B-LOC travels to B-LOC , while the B-LOC team heads to the B-LOC for first-round matches March 1-2 . The other two first-round ties will pit hosts B-LOC against the B-LOC I-LOC and visiting B-LOC against B-LOC . The semifinals are July 19-20 , and the final September 27- 28 . Life on the road this year did not slow the B-MISC , who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host B-LOC on September 28-29 in B-LOC I-LOC . " Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the B-MISC , " B-LOC captain B-PER I-PER I-PER said at the draw . " That is our sole goal . " The B-LOC I-LOC edged B-LOC in B-LOC 3-2 in the opening round in April , and then blanked B-LOC 5-0 in B-LOC last month in the semifinals . The victory against B-LOC marked the B-MISC I-MISC debut of B-PER I-PER , who became a naturalised B-LOC citizen in 1994 . B-PER easily won both her singles matches and B-PER is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again . " I told B-PER we need her if we want to win , " B-PER said . B-PER 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to B-MISC I-MISC veteran B-PER I-PER I-PER have forced B-PER to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match . B-PER was forced to withdraw from the B-MISC I-MISC . " We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries , " said B-PER . " What we like would be B-PER , ( B-MISC champion B-PER ) B-PER and B-PER I-PER I-PER . " If she can get that threesome together , B-PER will feel good about her chances against the B-LOC 's formidable duo of B-PER I-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER . " To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses , " said B-PER . TENNIS - SATURDAY 'S RESULTS FROM THE B-MISC I-MISC .

" In the early innings , I was struggling , I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch . I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh , eighth or ninth . I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings . " " He has a devastating sinker , " observed B-ORG manager B-PER I-PER . " The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league .

TENNIS - B-PER REFUSES TO QO QUIETLY . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 Refusing to go quietly in the night , B-PER I-PER extended his stay at his 14th and last B-MISC I-MISC when B-PER I-PER , trailing and hurting , quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday . The 30-year-old B-PER , a former two-time B-MISC champion , had wrestled control of the match away from B-PER when the B-MISC , hampered by a left hamstring injury , decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC . " A win is a win . I 'll take it , " B-PER , who has announced that this will be his last B-MISC I-MISC event , said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory . Ironically , B-PER two years ago ended B-PER I-PER 's B-MISC I-MISC career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match . After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set , B-PER was not surprised by B-PER 's decision not to go on . " I knew he had problems with something , " B-PER said . " I really was n't surprised . " B-PER had his own problems early in the match as the B-MISC battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while B-PER was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him . " I did n't really feel good to begin with , I had problems finding the timing on the ball , seeing the ball , " said B-PER , who upset B-MISC champion and fifth-seeded B-PER I-PER in the first round . " This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard . I had to fight hard . " B-PER 's tenacity paid off in the second set . B-PER lost his own serve twice , but he rallied for three breaks of his own , the last to wrap up the set . " That 's where the match sort of changed , " said B-PER . " I think once I got that second set , I felt a lot better about my game . " B-PER is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer . " It does n't look all that bad , " B-PER said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against B-PER 's B-MISC countryman B-PER I-PER . However , the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final . " I 'm always being realistic , " said B-PER . " Like I said many times , I think it 's a very little chance , but nothing is impossible . If I play great tennis , that could take me a long way . " A lot of things can happen , like tonight .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-LOC dominated their B-MISC I-MISC group four qualifier against B-LOC on Saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors ' defence and had to settle for a goalless draw . B-LOC , who thrashed B-LOC 5-1 in their opening group four match , were unable to repeat their performance . B-LOC 's best chance came in the 63rd minute with B-PER I-PER of B-ORG I-ORG taking advantage of a scramble in the B-MISC penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post . They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to B-PER I-PER but he hit his shot wide . B-ORG 's B-PER I-PER went close for B-LOC in the 65th minute when he forced B-MISC goalkeeper B-PER I-PER to a diving save . Two B-LOC players were shown yellow cards , captain B-PER I-PER for bringing down B-PER I-PER and B-PER for arguing against the referee 's decision .

" B-ORG I-ORG 's B-PER I-PER , who gave an impressive performance , said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes . " Somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch . We have lost two points . The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won , " he said . B-MISC coach B-PER I-PER said his team had displayed great fighting spirit but sometimes lacked ideas .

The victory extended to 29 matches B-LOC 's unbeaten run under coach B-PER I-PER , their B-MISC I-MISC semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out , but was marred by the sending-off of B-ORG central defender B-PER I-PER . B-PER was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence , fouling B-MISC substitute B-PER I-PER who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the B-ORG defender in the back . Both goals came early in the second half after B-LOC had surprised the B-MISC with three half-time substitutions . After a sterile first half , B-LOC injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of B-ORG 's B-PER I-PER . This allowed B-PER to play further up and his cross from the right fell for B-PER , who has joined B-ORG of B-LOC from B-ORG since missing the B-MISC championship finals through injury , to score after a mistake by midfielder B-PER I-PER I-PER . Within four minutes B-PER was returning the compliment for B-PER , playing a one-two with the B-ORG I-ORG forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper B-PER I-PER . B-PER , beginning the 22-month countdown to B-LOC 's hosting of the B-MISC I-MISC finals , said : " We have an identity ( as a team ) which we are going to work on .

B-MISC fans , upset at their team 's 2-0 first-half deficit , ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence . Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order . The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute B-PER I-PER who rekindled B-MISC hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned B-MISC goalkeeper B-PER I-PER I-PER . But B-PER , who had come on just four minutes earlier , turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with B-MISC referee B-PER I-PER . B-PER I-PER had opened the scoring for B-LOC after 13 minutes , whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender B-PER I-PER from the edge of the penalty area . Brazilian-born B-PER I-PER then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper B-PER I-PER from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval , B-LOC 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by B-PER I-PER which B-PER I-PER tipped over . The visitors , seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in B-MISC I-MISC in June , repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but B-PER I-PER was able to block several sharply-angled efforts . With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in B-LOC , B-LOC could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal . But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when B-PER I-PER fumbled a hard B-PER I-PER shot and B-PER I-PER almost pounced on the loose ball . B-LOC 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when B-PER put the ball over the bar from close range with B-PER beaten .

B-LOC 1996-09-01 A B-MISC newspaper said B-PER I-PER was so shaken by an B-ORG attempt on her life when she was prime minister in 1984 that an astrologer was asked to warn her against future threats . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG quoted B-PER I-PER as saying she did a horoscope chart for B-PER , a B-MISC , after she narrowly escaped death in the B-MISC guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the B-ORG I-ORG conference more than a decade ago . B-PER said B-PER 's press secretary B-PER I-PER asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future . " B-PER I-PER told me that if I ever heard anything that indicated danger I was to let him know , " B-PER said . B-PER said she never had to telephone . She added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves . B-PER was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was " a load of rubbish " and that he could not recall asking B-PER to keep a watch on B-PER 's stars .

B-PER once pledged to set up a B-MISC parliament if the B-ORG won the next general election , which must be held by May 1997 . But many activists were dismayed when he abruptly decided earlier this year to hold a two-question referendum on the issue , asking B-MISC if they wanted a separate parliament and if it should have tax-raising powers .

The seven , including a carpenter and a businessmen and whose ages ranged from 25 to 38 years old , were ordered to be held in jail until another hearing next week . No pleas were entered at the preliminary hearing . They were accused of taking over B-MISC I-MISC which was flying from B-LOC , B-LOC , to B-LOC , B-LOC . All the hostages were freed on Tuesday after the plane landed at B-LOC airport , north of B-LOC . The men have claimed political asylum in B-LOC saying they were persecuted while in B-LOC . Their court appearance means they will face trial and possible imprisonment in B-LOC before their applications for asylum are considered . Under B-MISC law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences . After a search of the aircraft following the hijack , police found only knives and fake explosives . Opposition group says B-MISC advance in north B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-31 An B-MISC opposition group in exile said on Saturday it had received reports that B-MISC forces were shelling and advancing on the B-MISC town of B-LOC in northern B-LOC . A B-MISC spokesman of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said B-MISC artillery was shelling the city and B-MISC tanks had advanced to within 10 km ( six miles ) of B-LOC , the administrative centre of the B-MISC rebel-controlled region of northern B-LOC . " At 4.50 a.m. B-LOC time ( 0050 B-MISC ) B-MISC forces began an artillery attack on the outskirts of B-LOC , " the spokesman , who asked not to be identified , told B-ORG in a telephone call . There was no independent confirmation of the report which the spokesman said came from the organisation 's members in B-LOC . He said damage and casualties in the city were heavy and B-MISC forces were defending the city . President B-PER I-PER on Friday ordered the B-LOC military to ready itself for any possible action as B-LOC turned up the heat in an escalating crisis over B-MISC troop movements in northern B-LOC . On Thursday , B-LOC accused B-LOC of aggression and said it reserved the right to retaliate for B-LOC 's alleged deployment of troops into northern B-LOC , where fighting broke out between the two main B-MISC I-MISC rebel groups two weeks ago . Two die in B-LOC restaurant blast - radio . B-LOC 1996-08-31 Two people were killed when a hand grenade exploded in a restaurant near B-LOC late on Friday , B-MISC radio reported on Saturday . The report , monitored by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , quoted security services as saying six other people were injured in the blast in the town of B-LOC . An estimated 50,000 people had been killed in political violence in B-LOC since 1992 , when army-backed authorities cancelled a general election that B-MISC fundamentalists had been expected to win .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-31 B-MISC I-MISC right-wing Afrikaners on Saturday revived their campaign for a form of self-rule , identifying a sparsely-populated area in B-LOC I-LOC province as the best place for a home of their own . B-PER I-PER , leader of the B-ORG I-ORG party , told a news conference in B-LOC self-determination for B-MISC could begin at local government level . " Certain powers can be delegated from the provincial level , towards the sub-regions , " he said . " We think that the B-MISC model within this new , multi- ethnic society of B-LOC I-LOC will have to develop experimentally with world thinking in this regard . " B-PER broke with other right-wing whites in 1994 by taking part in the country 's first all-race elections in April of that year , saying the only way to attain self-determination was by cooperating with President B-PER I-PER 's majority B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Some right-wingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the run-up to the elections , saying the alternative was war . Their threats came to nothing . B-PER has hailed clauses in B-LOC I-LOC 's new constitution as making possible a form of self-rule for the B-MISC , descendants of the country 's B-MISC , B-MISC and B-MISC settlers . According to state television , B-PER told the news conference the self-rule model should be introduced in parts of the B-LOC I-LOC provinces where a majority of people -- whites and mixed-race Coloureds -- speak B-MISC . B-MISC refugee group calls for calm over census . B-LOC 1996-08-31 A B-MISC refugee lobby group called on Saturday for calm in refugee camps in eastern B-LOC during a census from Sunday to be conducted by aid workers . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) urged the B-ORG High Commissioner for Refugees to avoid any " policing approach " and to calm refugees by explaining the aims of the operation . " The B-ORG appeals to all refugees to prepare themselves calmly for the demands of the census agents because it will be in their ultimate interest , " the group said in a statement . It said refugees feared census takers would use indelible ink to mark them so they could be detected by B-MISC government troops and mistreated if they were forced back into B-LOC . B-ORG officials said more than 1,000 aid workers will take part in the census from Sunday until Tuesday of the estimated 727,000 refugees in camps around the eastern B-MISC border town of B-LOC . Only about 100 refugees a week are returning voluntarily to B-LOC in contrast to the 600 babies born in the camps weekly . B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER I-PER said at the end of a visit to B-LOC last week that the B-MISC and B-MISC governments agreed on an " organised , massive and unconditional repatriation " of the 1.1 million B-MISC refugees in B-LOC . He said the repatriation would be carried out swiftly and would be enormous , starting with the closure of refugee camps . B-ORG said it feared forced expulsions would start in days . B-MISC troops expelled 15,000 refugees in August last year . Many of the 1.1 million B-MISC B-MISC refugees in B-LOC and nearly 600,000 in B-LOC refuse to go home , saying they fear reprisals for the 1994 genocide in B-LOC of up to a million people by B-MISC . B-ORG monitors B-MISC move towards tense village . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-ORG said it was closely monitoring the movement of about 75 B-MISC men towards the village of B-LOC in B-LOC 's B-MISC republic on Saturday , two days after a violent confrontation with B-MISC . " I have to report this morning that we have in fact received reports ... that up to 75 B-MISC men are believed to be approaching B-LOC , " B-ORG spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel B-PER I-PER said in B-LOC . B-PER said that B-ORG troops had set up a checkpoint on the road between B-LOC and B-LOC to establish the identities and intentions of the men headed towards the village . B-LOC is a B-MISC village on B-MISC I-MISC republic territory . B-MISC were driven from the village during the 43- month B-MISC war and most of their houses were destroyed . Some B-MISC began returning to rebuild their properties earlier in the week . Fights and shooting broke out between the B-MISC and B-MISC police on Thursday and B-ORG troops finally brought restored order . A B-ORG reporter who entered B-LOC on Saturday morning found it tranquil but B-ORG troops and B-ORG police were seen on the ground and B-ORG helicopters flew overhead . B-MISC exuberant but cautious on peace deal . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-31 Crowds of pro-independence B-MISC greeted a newly-signed peace deal by singing , dancing and firing guns in the air on Saturday , but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty . More than a thousand women , children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of B-LOC on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital B-LOC about 25 km ( 12 miles ) away . The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced . Adults in the crowd carried posters of former B-MISC leader B-PER I-PER -- who declared independence in 1991 -- and children , carrying photographs of him , called " Troops out ! " . B-MISC military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by B-MISC peace envoy B-PER I-PER in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists . It involves the withdrawal of B-MISC troops sent to B-LOC in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict -- the status of the B-MISC B-LOC I-LOC region . But the people in the crowd on Saturday , who had turned out in support of the rebels , did not seem sure that the war was over . " We hope for the best , that it really has ended so we can live in peace . It 's our only dream , " said a 30-year-old woman , B-PER I-PER . B-PER I-PER , with her 10-year-old son beside her , shared the guarded optimism . " We really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , " said B-PER , adding that she was from B-LOC . B-LOC is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in B-LOC and B-MISC leader B-PER I-PER , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if B-MISC troops leave . But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists . Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars , firing their guns in the air , as the crowd rushed towards them . B-PER I-PER , in his late 20 's , dressed in black and carrying a machine gun , was welcomed by his mother and sister . " Two sons have come back , " said his mother B-PER I-PER . " It 's the end . We believe in B-PER . " B-PER joked that his sister B-PER was a rebel too , and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the B-MISC war cry " B-PER I-PER " ( B-PER is Greatest ) and " Freedom for B-LOC ! " . The fighter , sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher , said that the strict B-MISC law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace . " The war has ended if everything works out , if there is law there will be power . Only B-MISC ( B-MISC law ) can end the war . " B-MISC group to bid for B-ORG newsstand chain - paper . B-LOC 1996-08-31 A B-MISC consortium including the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) plans to rival B-LOC 's B-ORG in bidding for B-MISC state-owned press distribution chain B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG daily said on Saturday . B-ORG I-ORG said its own publisher , mineral water firm B-ORG , and a group headed by B-MISC businessman B-PER I-PER were forming a consortium which would offer about $ 120 million , with finance provided by B-ORG . The consortium wanted 40 percent of B-ORG 's shares , the state would get 20 percent of B-ORG and 40 percent would be offered on the B-LOC stock exchange . " This B-MISC would guarantee a dispersal of capital , preventing anyone from taking total control over B-ORG and dictating market conditions , " the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying , without giving a name . A consortium of press distributor B-ORG and B-MISC publishers group B-ORG are seeking more than than 50 percent of B-ORG and B-MISC President B-PER I-PER is likely to support its case when he visits B-LOC in September , the daily said . News-stand chain B-ORG , which controls about 65 percent of B-LOC 's press distribution market , had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995 . It has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country 's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism . B-ORG I-ORG said the new , open consortium , which also included several listed B-MISC firms , would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister B-PER I-PER of its plans . It aims to invest $ 200 million in B-ORG over five years -- more than the sum B-ORG says it needs to upgrade its outlets . Initially B-LOC offered up to 75 percent of B-ORG but in March B-PER cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity . Two consortia -- B-ORG and a consortium of a B-MISC B-ORG group and B-MISC firms -- placed initial bids . But after the change of tender conditions B-MISC investors pulled out and B-ORG decided to bid jointly with B-ORG . B-PER said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for B-ORG , in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled . -- B-PER I-PER +48 22 653 9700 Three B-MISC soldiers killed in gun attack . B-LOC 1996-08-31 Three B-MISC servicemen were killed on Saturday when unidentified gunmen attacked guards at an anti-aircraft installation outside B-LOC , B-ORG news agency said . It quoted military officials as saying the attack took place in B-LOC I-LOC 70 km ( 45 miles ) from the capital . The officials said the attackers had seized two B-MISC assault rifles and disappeared . Attacks on servicemen aimed at seizing their guns have become frequent in B-LOC where the number of violent crimes committed with the use of fire arms is growing . B-MISC novelist B-PER I-PER I-PER dies at 79 . B-LOC 1996-08-31 One of B-LOC 's most acclaimed authors , B-PER I-PER I-PER , died at the age of 79 , the official newspaper B-ORG reported on Saturday . B-PER 's first novel , " B-MISC I-MISC , " was published in 1960 , a year after the B-MISC revolution brought President B-PER I-PER to power . The book , which has been translated into 40 languages , deals with a day in the life of B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC , B-PER 's native city , under the B-MISC government of B-PER I-PER . The titles of his other novels translate as " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " ( 1963 ) , " B-MISC I-MISC " ( 1964 ) , " B-MISC I-MISC " ( 1975 ) , " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " ( 1977 ) and " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " ( 1982 ) , followed by " B-MISC I-MISC , " " B-MISC I-MISC " and , most recently , " B-MISC I-MISC . " B-ORG called " B-MISC I-MISC " B-PER 's " greatest gift to the modern novel in our B-LOC . " The author said in an interview shortly before his death that his own experiences had lent his books their strong sense of realism . " I 'm a thief of ideas , " he said . " The stories have been given to me by people . " In the same interview , published by B-ORG I-ORG on Saturday , B-PER was asked if he feared death . " Death is not a punishment -- death is the end of life 's punishment , " he said . B-ORG Ambassador B-PER arrives in B-LOC . B-PER 1996-08-31 The B-LOC ambassador to the B-ORG I-ORG , B-PER I-PER , arrived in B-LOC late Friday for talks on various B-ORG I-ORG issues with B-MISC officials as part of a five-nation B-MISC I-MISC tour . B-PER will meet Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER I-PER Monday for talks on issues currently up for debate on the council , of which B-LOC is a non-permanent member , a B-LOC embassy statement said . The two will also discuss various issues affecting relations between the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC , local officials said . B-PER , who arrived from B-LOC , will rest most of the weekend in B-LOC , officials said . Her official programme will begin on Monday , and she will leave that day for B-LOC to attend a B-MISC I-MISC summit meeting in the city of B-LOC . Her tour will also include B-LOC and B-LOC . B-MISC army attacked in B-LOC state - report . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-30 A group of heavily-armed men attacked a military convoy in the western B-MISC state of B-LOC on Friday , killing one soldier and wounding two , radio reports said . B-ORG I-ORG quoted local police in the town of B-LOC , B-LOC , 80 km ( 50 miles ) south of the state capital B-LOC , as saying 40 to 50 armed men attacked the convoy . B-PER I-PER , a police commander in B-LOC , told B-ORG I-ORG the group was armed with B-MISC and other high-powered assault rifles and wore military-style fatigues . B-PER said he thought the attackers were criminals linked to drug trafficking or kidnapping in the area . " We often see people dressed in military-style clothing here , " he said . The attack comes a day after rebels of the self-styled B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) launched coordinated attacks in at least three B-MISC states , killing up to 14 people and wounding about 20 . B-LOC said to fear dissidents more than criminals . B-LOC 1996-08-31 The detention of veteran dissident B-PER I-PER showed B-LOC 's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation 's leadership , a human rights activist said on Saturday . B-PER I-PER , executive director of the B-MISC I-MISC group B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said B-PER 's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national " B-MISC I-MISC " campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death . Although supposedly aimed at criminals , dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign , which is meant to strengthen the B-ORG I-ORG 's grip on power as senior leader B-PER I-PER nears death , B-PER said in an interview . " B-LOC is going through this power transition period . The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent , " said B-PER , in B-LOC to attend an B-ORG I-ORG conference on human rights in B-LOC . He said one of B-PER 's apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption . B-PER said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day B-LOC would pay a high price . " Those issues are not going to go away by repression . You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive , " he said . B-PER was arrested in the east B-LOC city of B-LOC by security officers who told the dissident 's family he would be sent to a study class -- a euphemism for coercive ideological reform . B-PER , 45 , was sentenced last month to one year 's " re-education by labour " but was released because of ill-health . B-PER said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with B-PER to attempt suicide . Police beat B-PER and his colleague , B-PER I-PER , and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well , B-PER said . B-LOC hails B-LOC , B-ORG for peace deal support . B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-LOC president B-PER I-PER expressed gratitude to B-MISC president B-PER and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) on Saturday for supporting talks that ended a conflict with local B-MISC rebels . " I extend the deepest gratitude ... to your excellency for your untiring and invaluable friendship and support , " B-PER told B-PER in a letter . The full text of the letter was released to reporters on Saturday . B-LOC served as the host to the series of negotiations which culminated in the initialling of the agreement last Friday . The formal signing of the peace agreement is scheduled on Monday in B-LOC . B-PER said the peace agreement " shall bring down the curtain on a long and storied era of strife in B-LOC history . " The war claimed more than 125,000 lives in the southern B-LOC island over a quarter of a century . B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER says military rulers abuse law . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-LOC 's democracy leader B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement . " The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement , " B-PER I-PER told reporters at her B-LOC home . B-PER I-PER said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May , and about 30 of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms . In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement , detaining over 260 members of B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) ahead of a party congress . Most were released but several dozen remain in custody . The B-MISC government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown , including B-PER I-PER 's assistant B-PER I-PER . The military government , which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state . But B-PER I-PER disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested B-ORG supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials . " When our people are tried , they are tried in a very secretive way . Their families are not told , " she said . B-PER I-PER , who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on B-LOC 's government , was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995 . Several other leading members of the B-ORG have served prison terms . The B-ORG party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll . " This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play , " she said . " They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . " B-PER I-PER said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison . " Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail , " she said . " Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years . " Most political prisoners are held in B-LOC 's B-LOC I-LOC . Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse . " If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence , " B-PER I-PER said . B-PER I-PER , an elected member of parliament for the B-ORG , died in early August after being at B-LOC for six years . His death came five weeks after B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER , a close friend of B-PER I-PER and B-MISC honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at B-LOC . B-PER I-PER said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement . But she said she and the B-ORG would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to B-LOC even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself . " We will carry on . Nobody is free from arrest in B-LOC . " B-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC ethylene venture . B-LOC 1996-08-31 The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG of the B-LOC I-LOC will invest $ 4 billion to build an ethylene plant in B-LOC city in northern B-LOC , the B-ORG I-ORG said on Saturday . The plant will have annual production of 400,000 tonnes , the newspaper said . It gave no further details of the venture . B-LOC boasts a range of infrastructure facilities , attracting several multinational oil companies to invest in recent years . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG plans to build a lubricants blender in a bonded zone in B-LOC , the newspaper said . Multinational firms including B-ORG , B-ORG and B-ORG , were also attracted to B-LOC due to B-LOC 's rising demand for lube and oil-based products , the newspaper said . It gave no further details . B-LOC I-LOC urges B-LOC I-LOC to return war veteran . B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-LOC I-LOC demanded on Saturday that B-LOC I-LOC return a northern war veteran who has been in the B-LOC since the 1950-53 war , B-LOC 's unification ministry said . " ...I request the immediate repatriation of B-PER I-PER to B-LOC I-LOC where his family is waiting , " B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG president B-PER I-PER said in a telephone message to his southern couterpart , B-PER I-PER . B-PER said B-PER had been critically ill with a cerebral haemorrhage . The message was distributed to the press by the B-MISC I-MISC unification ministry . B-PER , an unrepentant communist , was captured during the B-MISC War and released after spending more than 30 years in a southern jail . He submitted a petition to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in 1993 asking for his repatriation . The domestic B-ORG news agency said the B-MISC I-MISC government would consider the northern demand only if the B-LOC accepted B-LOC 's requests , which include regular reunions of families split by the B-MISC War . Government officials were not available to comment . B-LOC I-LOC in 1993 unconditionally repatriated B-PER I-PER , a nothern partisan seized by the B-LOC during the war and jailed for more than three decades . B-MISC police hold veteran dissident . B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-MISC police have detained veteran dissident B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC I-MISC pressure group B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Saturday . Police in B-LOC , capital of the eastern province of B-LOC , told B-PER 's family that B-PER would be sent to a study class , a euphemism for coercive ideological reform , the group said . Police gave no reason for detaining B-PER on Friday and would not let his family meet him or say where he was being held , the group said . Police also would not say why B-PER was being sent to a study class -- a holdover from the chaotic B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC -- or say when he would be released , the group said . B-PER 's family and B-LOC police could not be reached for immediate comment . The group demanded B-PER 's release and said his detention was a dangerous signal B-LOC was returning to its B-MISC I-MISC days . Last month , B-PER , 45 , a veteran dissident of the 1979 B-ORG I-ORG movement , was ordered to serve one year of " re-education through labour " , but released because of poor health . Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts . B-PER was jailed for two years for organising street protests after the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at B-LOC 's B-LOC I-LOC on June 4 , 1989 , with heavy loss of life . B-MISC authorities appeared to be using administrative punishment more frequently to take dissidents out of circulation without having to go through a more complicated judicial process to impose criminal sentences , B-MISC diplomats have said . B-LOC police detains dissident B-PER I-PER . B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-MISC police have detained dissident B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC I-MISC pressure group B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Saturday . Police detained B-PER on Friday and would not let his family meet him or say where he was being held , the group said . The pressure group said B-PER would be sent to a study class , often a euphemism in B-LOC for ideological reform . B-PER 's family could not immediately be reached for comment . Last month , B-PER , 45 , a veteran dissident of the 1979 B-ORG I-ORG movement , was ordered to serve one year of " re-education through labour " , but released because of poor health . Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts . B-PER was jailed for two years for organising street protests after the military brutally crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at B-LOC 's B-LOC I-LOC on June 4 , 1989 , with heavy loss of life . B-LOC I-LOC jails 88-year-old drug trafficker . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-31 An 88-year-old army veteran was jailed for 15 years by a B-LOC I-LOC court for drugs trafficking after he admitted he had stashed heroin under his mattress , a newspaper said on Saturday . " I am sorry to my ancestors for five generations , " B-PER I-PER told the B-ORG I-ORG after sentencing on Friday , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said . " Tell my sons to collect my bones , " he said after hearing he was likely to die behind bars . B-PER , a former army secretary of the B-MISC Nationalist regime which fled from mainland B-LOC to B-LOC in 1949 , pleaded guilty to trafficking 42 kg ( 92 pounds ) of drugs that could have been turned into 25 kg ( 55 pounds ) of heroin . The ex-officer admitted stashing heroin under his mattress . B-LOC cities to ban disposable plastic containers . B-LOC 1996-08-31 Two B-MISC cities are to ban the use of disposable plastic containers as part of efforts to fight pollution , the B-ORG I-ORG said on Saturday . Authorities in B-LOC , capital of the central province of B-LOC , would punish those who sell or use disposable plastic containers from September 1 , the newspaper said . It did not elaborate . The city 's industrial and commercial departments would confiscate disposable plastic containers and police would prevent new ones from entering the city , it said . B-LOC consumes more than 200 million disposable plastic containers a year , the newspaper said . The boomtown of B-LOC , capital of the southern province of B-LOC , would ban disposable plastic containers by the end of 1996 , it said . B-LOC uses up 500,000 such containers each day , the newspaper said . It gave no further details . B-MISC I-MISC say B-MISC troops enter north B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-MISC troops on Saturday entered B-MISC northern B-LOC in the wake of an assault backed by B-LOC into the region , an B-MISC I-MISC group told B-ORG . " They entered this morning . They have occupied the area to the depth of 40 km ( 25 miles ) . They have established a headquarters in B-LOC , " B-PER I-PER of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) told B-ORG by telephone from B-LOC . B-PER said he did not know the size or nature of the B-MISC force in northern B-LOC , but said B-ORG fighters had been easily outgunned in the area close to the B-MISC border and had quickly withdrawn further west . " They were far too strong , " he said . B-PER said he did not know if there were any casualties . A B-ORG official in B-LOC said the B-ORG , backed by B-MISC tanks , heavy artillery and helicopters had taken control of the main northern B-MISC city of B-LOC after fighting on Saturday . B-LOC President B-PER I-PER has authorised the repositioning of B-LOC firepower in the B-LOC region in response to the B-MISC attacks . The B-ORG charges that the rival B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which took control of B-LOC in fighting in December 1994 , has backing from B-LOC . The B-ORG accuses the B-ORG of collaborating with B-LOC . Northern B-LOC has been under B-MISC I-MISC control since after the 1991 B-MISC I-MISC .

The monitoring committee was set up to deal with violations of an April 25 ceasefire understanding that ended 17 days of fighting between B-LOC and the guerrillas . The understandings forbid firing from or at civilian targest but do not rule out guerrilla attacks on B-MISC troops and their local militia allies in south B-LOC . Around 1,000 B-MISC troops patrol a 15 km ( nine-mile ) south B-LOC occupation zone which the B-MISC state carved out in 1985 to prevent attacks on its northern bordder .

B-LOC 1996-08-31 B-LOC 's Deputy Prime Minister B-PER I-PER said on Saturday B-MISC troops were fighting in northern B-LOC to aid B-MISC rebel leader B-PER I-PER against rival forces . " The leadership has decided to provide support and military aid to Mr B-PER I-PER and his comrades to enable them confront the vicious aggression ... from ( B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG chief ) B-PER I-PER , " B-PER said in a statement carried by the official B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . B-PER said B-LOC 's military intervention , the first on such scale since the B-LOC and allies decided to protect B-MISC I-MISC against B-LOC , was in response to a plea from B-PER to President B-PER I-PER to back him militarily and save his people from attacks by B-LOC and B-PER . He said B-PER sent a message to B-PER on August 22 in which he said : " The conspiracy is beyond our capability therefore we plead with your excellency to order B-MISC armed forces to interfere to help us to evade the foreign threat and put an end to B-PER 's treason and conspiracy . " B-ORG relief officials said they were not aware that the tanks advancing on B-LOC were manned by B-MISC troops as they advanced from KDP-controlled areas and raised B-ORG flags .

B-LOC 1996-08-31 These are the leading stories in the B-MISC press on Saturday . B-ORG has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy . B-ORG I-ORG - After B-LOC called on B-LOC to respect B-MISC immigrants ' dignity , B-LOC says it welcomes legal B-MISC residents . - B-LOC 's exports of spare parts amounted to 220 million dinars in 1995 . B-ORG I-ORG - Trade talks between B-LOC and the B-ORG I-ORG . - Speaker of parliament B-PER I-PER arrives in B-LOC to represent President B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER at the B-MISC revolution anniversary celebrations . ( $ 1 = 0.96 dinar ) Automakers , B-LOC agency plan air bag safety ads . B-LOC 1996-08-31 Automakers , suppliers , insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks . Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies , pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts . Since 1993 , 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags , which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour . The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation 's busiest interstate highways during the B-MISC I-MISC weekend , including B-LOC I-LOC on the B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC in the B-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC in B-LOC . The boards read : " Air Bag Safety : Everyone Buckled , Kids in Back . " B-PER I-PER , executive director of the industry-funded B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts . A child 's chances of being killed in a car accident , whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not , is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat , she said . The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing " smart " air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly . Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized , unbelted adult male , not a small child . Automakers petitioned the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries . " Even if changes are made to airbags today , we 'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology , " B-PER said . " The public has n't been getting the message . " Two die as B-LOC I-LOC motel explodes and burns .

Eyewitnesses told B-LOC television stations they saw a gasoline truck parked behind the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC and smelled gasoline shortly before the explosion . Fire department officials said they were investigating the cause of the blast and searching for any more casualties . Officials did not immediately identify the victims . Local hospital officials said a few firemen were treated for smoke inhalation but there were no other injuries . Car kills two trying to avoid B-LOC drag race .

They said 200 fighter planes , including 79 on the aircraft carrier B-MISC I-MISC , were already in the B-LOC ; the aircraft carrier B-MISC was in the eastern B-MISC with 79 more , and an air expeditionary force with up to 40 more was ready to fly from the B-LOC I-LOC if ordered . " Yesterday the president ordered the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG to take prudent planning steps to have forces ready to deploy to the region should he direct us to do so , " B-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER said . " We have taken those prudent planning steps . " B-PER said on Saturday he had ordered B-LOC forces in the B-LOC to go on high alert and was reinforcing them in response to B-MISC attacks on B-MISC dissidents in northern B-LOC . " These developments ... cause me grave concern , " B-PER said at a campaign stop in B-LOC , B-LOC . But he added , " It is premature at this time , and I want to emphasize that , highly premature to speculate on any response we might have . " The B-LOC defense officials said military flights to enforce no-fly zones in both northern and southern B-LOC doubled over the weekend . B-PER said B-MISC military forces overran the city of B-LOC , which has been held since 1994 by B-MISC rebels who B-LOC says are backed by B-LOC .

B-PER was threatened with violence , then locked into a room to be interrogated on suspicion of " promoting activities hostile to the state " while his guests were taken away , the magazine said . The ministry spokesman said the B-MISC embassy immediately made a sharp protest to the B-LOC government .

Controversial B-ORG film screened at B-LOC festival . B-PER I-PER VENICE , B-LOC 1996-08-31 Dublin-born director B-PER I-PER says he never lost more sleep over a film than over " B-MISC I-MISC " , his controversial epic about the B-ORG which has its premiere on Saturday at the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . The film , starring B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER , recounts the life of B-PER I-PER , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's Director of Intelligence who fought for B-MISC independence from 1919 to 1921 . Although not due for release in B-LOC until early next year , some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in B-MISC B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER defends his decision to make the film , whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research , saying it was " more about history than any political statement " . " The film spares neither the B-MISC nor the B-MISC in its depiction of the savagery of the time , " B-PER said in a statement released by B-ORG I-ORG . " How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ? Very rarely . " B-PER , whose 1992 film " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the B-ORG , said B-PER was more than just a revolutionary . " He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world , from B-PER I-PER in B-LOC to B-PER I-PER in B-LOC , " B-PER said . " B-PER would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today . He was a soldier and a statesman and , over time , a man of peace . " B-PER , the B-MISC I-MISC actor who was nominated for an B-PER for best actor for his performance in " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " , plays the lead role in B-PER 's film . B-PER I-PER portrays B-PER I-PER , B-PER ' best friend , and rival for the love of B-PER I-PER , played by B-PER . Much of the film was shot on location in B-LOC with B-PER using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras . A set , however , was used for the fighting scenes . Noting that information about B-PER was " as mysterious as the existence he maintained " , B-PER said he made some historical assumptions in the film . " I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches , " he said . " I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have . It is a very true film . " One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of B-PER , who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with B-LOC , in an ambush in 1922 . " I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' B-MISC I-MISC ' , but I 'll never make a more important one , " B-PER said . " In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of B-LOC as they are today . " B-LOC stocks seen steady in absence of big players . B-LOC 1996-08-31 Shares on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) may remain steady as small investors are expected to target mainly blue chips while overseas investors will prefer to keep to the sidelines when the market reopens after B-MISC Friday weekend , brokers said .
