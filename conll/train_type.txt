B-ORG rejects B-MISC call to boycott B-MISC lamb . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-22 The B-ORG I-ORG said on Thursday it disagreed with B-MISC advice to consumers to shun B-MISC lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep . B-LOC 's representative to the B-ORG I-ORG 's veterinary committee B-PER I-PER said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than B-LOC until the scientific advice was clearer . " We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , " the B-ORG 's chief spokesman B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER told a news briefing . He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the B-ORG I-ORG . He said a proposal last month by B-ORG Farm Commissioner B-PER I-PER to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health . B-PER proposed B-MISC measures after reports from B-LOC and B-LOC that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) -- mad cow disease . But B-PER agreed to review his proposal after the B-ORG 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health . B-MISC Farm Minister B-PER I-PER I-PER had earlier accused B-PER at an B-ORG farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . " . Only B-LOC and B-LOC backed B-PER 's proposal . The B-ORG 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials . Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to B-MISC which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . B-MISC farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that B-MISC government advice to consumers to avoid B-MISC lamb might influence consumers across B-LOC . " What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take B-LOC 's lead , " B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) chairman B-PER I-PER I-PER said on B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a B-MISC report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef . B-LOC imported 47,600 sheep from B-LOC last year , nearly half of total imports . It brought in 4,275 tonnes of B-MISC mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports . Rare B-PER song draft sells for almost $ 17,000 . B-LOC 1996-08-22 A rare early handwritten draft of a song by B-LOC guitar legend B-PER I-PER was sold for almost $ 17,000 on Thursday at an auction of some of the late musician 's favourite possessions . A B-LOC restaurant paid 10,925 pounds ( $ 16,935 ) for the draft of " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " , which B-PER penned on a piece of B-LOC hotel stationery in late 1966 . At the end of a January 1967 concert in the B-MISC city of B-LOC he threw the sheet of paper into the audience , where it was retrieved by a fan . Buyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by B-PER 's former girlfriend B-PER I-PER , who lived with him from 1966 to 1969 . They included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by B-PER to store his drugs , which an anonymous B-MISC purchaser bought for 5,060 pounds ( $ 7,845 ) . The guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 1970 aged 27 . B-LOC says B-LOC spoils atmosphere for talks . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC on Thursday accused B-LOC of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the B-LOC I-LOC with a visit to B-LOC by B-MISC Vice President B-PER I-PER this week that infuriated B-LOC . Speaking only hours after B-MISC state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with B-LOC , B-ORG I-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER told B-ORG : " The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the B-LOC authorities . " State media quoted B-LOC 's top negotiator with B-LOC , B-PER I-PER , as telling a visiting group from B-LOC on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks . " Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ... that is to end the state of hostility , " Thursday 's overseas edition of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG quoted B-PER as saying . The foreign ministry 's B-ORG told B-ORG I-ORG in an interview he had read reports of B-PER 's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with B-LOC , which B-LOC considers a renegade province . B-LOC , which has long opposed all B-LOC efforts to gain greater international recognition , was infuriated by a visit to B-LOC this week by B-MISC Vice President B-PER . B-LOC says time right for B-LOC talks . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC has said it was time for political talks with B-LOC and that the rival island should take practical steps towards that goal . Consultations should be held to set the time and format of the talks , the official B-ORG news agency quoted B-PER I-PER , executive vice chairman of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , as saying late on Wednesday . B-MISC July car registrations up 14.2 pct yr / yr . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-MISC first-time registrations of motor vehicles jumped 14.2 percent in July this year from the year-earlier period , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Thursday . The office said 356,725 new cars were registered in July 1996 -- 304,850 passenger cars and 15,613 trucks . The figures represent a 13.6 percent increase for passenger cars and a 2.2 percent decline for trucks from July 1995 . Motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period . The growth was partly due to an increased number of B-MISC buying B-MISC cars abroad , while manufacturers said that domestic demand was weak , the federal office said . Almost all B-MISC car manufacturers posted gains in registration numbers in the period . B-ORG I-ORG won 77,719 registrations , slightly more than a quarter of the total . B-ORG I-ORG together with B-ORG I-ORG came in second place with 49,269 registrations , 16.4 percent of the overall figure . Third was B-ORG with 35,563 registrations , or 11.7 percent . Only B-ORG and B-ORG had fewer registrations in July 1996 compared to last year 's July . B-ORG posted 3,420 registrations compared with 5522 registrations in July a year earlier . B-ORG 's registrations fell to 554 from 643 . B-MISC SOCIALISTS GIVE GREEN LIGHT TO PM FOR ELECTIONS .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC 's outgoing peace negotiator with B-LOC said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup . B-PER I-PER , who as B-LOC 's ambassador to B-LOC conducted unfruitful negotiations with B-LOC , told B-ORG I-ORG it looked like B-LOC wanted to talk rather than fight . " It appears to me the B-MISC priority is still to negotiate . The B-MISC are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in B-LOC is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said . B-PER is winding up his term as ambassador . He will be replaced by B-PER I-PER , a former B-MISC envoy to B-LOC and right-wing B-ORG party politician . B-LOC on Wednesday sent B-LOC a message , via B-LOC , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions . But it slammed B-LOC for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere . B-LOC accused B-LOC on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after B-MISC television reported that B-LOC had recently test fired a missile . It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes . " The message that we sent to ( B-MISC President B-PER I-PER ) B-PER is that B-LOC is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER told B-ORG I-ORG in an interview . Tension has mounted since B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER took office in June vowing to retain the B-LOC I-LOC B-LOC captured from B-LOC in the 1967 B-LOC I-LOC war . B-MISC peace talks have been deadlocked over the B-LOC since 1991 despite the previous government 's willingness to make B-LOC concessions . Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February . " The voices coming out of B-LOC are bad , not good . The media ... are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ... this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " B-PER said . " We expect from B-LOC , if its face is to peace , that it will answer B-LOC 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . " We do not want a war , B-PER forbid . No one benefits from wars . " B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG television said B-LOC had sent a " calming signal " to B-LOC . It gave no source for the report . B-PER and B-PER 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it . The television also said that B-PER had sent messages to reassure B-LOC via B-LOC , the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC . B-MISC diplomat denies nurses stranded in B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-22 A B-MISC diplomat on Thursday denied a B-MISC tabloid report this week that B-LOC was refusing exit visas to 100 B-MISC nurses trying to return home after working in the B-MISC I-MISC country . " This is not true . Up to today , we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in B-LOC without her will , and we have not received any complaint , " the B-MISC embassy 's charge d'affaires in B-LOC , B-PER I-PER , told B-ORG by telephone . B-LOC 's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to B-LOC to investigate , but B-PER said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries . He said that there are an estimated 800 B-MISC nurses working in B-LOC . Two B-MISC opposition leaders meet in B-LOC . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-22 An B-MISC exile group based in B-LOC vowed on Thursday to extend support to B-LOC 's B-MISC rebels after they were attacked by B-MISC troops deep inside B-LOC last month . A B-ORG I-ORG statement said its leader B-PER I-PER met in B-LOC the Secretary-General of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) B-PER I-PER on Wednesday and voiced his support to B-LOC 's rebel B-MISC . " B-MISC emphasised that the B-MISC B-ORG would continue to stand side by side with their B-MISC compatriots and the resistance movement in B-LOC I-LOC , " it said . A spokesman for the group said the meeting " signals a new level of cooperation between B-ORG I-ORG and the B-MISC I-MISC oppositions " . B-LOC heavily bombarded targets in northern B-LOC in July in pursuit of B-ORG guerrillas based in B-MISC I-MISC areas outside the control of the government in B-LOC . B-MISC I-MISC areas bordering B-LOC are under the control of guerrillas of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) group . B-ORG and B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) the two main B-MISC I-MISC factions , have had northern B-LOC under their control since B-MISC forces were ousted from B-LOC in the 1991 B-MISC I-MISC . Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a B-MISC ceasefire last year . B-ORG I-ORG said B-MISC troops had also been shelling B-ORG positions in B-LOC region in B-LOC province near the B-MISC border over the last two days . It said about 100 B-MISC I-MISC were killed or wounded in the attack . Both B-LOC and B-LOC mount air and land strikes at targets in northern B-LOC in pursuit of their own B-MISC rebels .

B-LOC approves B-PER 's flight to B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC gave B-MISC President B-PER I-PER permission on Thursday to fly over its territory to the B-LOC I-LOC , ending a brief B-MISC crisis , an B-PER adviser said . " The problem is over . The president 's aircraft has received permission to pass through B-MISC airspace but the president is not expected to travel to the B-LOC I-LOC before Monday , " B-PER I-PER I-PER told B-ORG . B-PER had been scheduled to meet former B-MISC prime minister B-PER I-PER in the B-LOC I-LOC town of B-LOC on Thursday but the venue was changed to B-LOC after B-LOC denied flight clearance to the B-MISC leader 's helicopters . B-MISC officials accused right-wing Prime Minister B-PER I-PER of trying to stop the B-LOC meeting by keeping B-PER grounded . B-PER subsequently cancelled a meeting between B-MISC and B-ORG officials , on civilian affairs , at the B-LOC I-LOC crossing between B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER I-PER said B-PER had decided against flying to the B-LOC I-LOC on Thursday , after B-LOC lifted the ban , because he had a busy schedule in B-LOC and would not be free until Monday . B-PER to meet B-PER in B-LOC after flight ban . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-PER I-PER will meet B-PER I-PER in B-LOC on Thursday after B-MISC said the right-wing B-MISC government had barred the B-MISC leader from flying to the B-LOC I-LOC for talks with the former prime minister . " The meeting between B-PER and B-PER will take place at B-LOC checkpoint in B-LOC and not in B-LOC as planned , " B-PER ' office said . B-MISC officials said the B-MISC government had barred B-PER from overflying B-LOC in a B-MISC helicopter to the B-LOC I-LOC in an attempt to bar the meeting with B-PER . B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER has accused opposition leader B-PER , who he defeated in May elections , of trying to undermine his B-ORG government 's authority to conduct peace talks . B-MISC B-LOC embassy says B-MISC guards going home . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-22 Three B-MISC guards brought to the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC last week by B-MISC hostages who escaped from the B-MISC militia will return to B-LOC in a few days , the B-MISC embassy in B-LOC I-LOC said on Thursday . " Our ambassador is in touch with the B-LOC foreign ministry . Their return to B-LOC will take place in two or three days , " an embassy official said . " The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland . There is no objection to their travel , " he added . The three B-MISC I-MISC guards were overpowered by seven B-MISC aircrew who escaped to B-LOC state B-LOC last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of B-MISC militia in B-LOC in southern B-LOC . The B-LOC said on Monday it would hand over the three to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , possibly last Tuesday . It has since been silent on the issue . When asked whether the three guards would travel back to B-LOC or the B-MISC capital B-LOC , the embassy official said : " That has not been decided , but possibly B-LOC . " B-LOC is the headquarters of the opposition B-MISC militia . B-LOC is controlled by President B-PER I-PER 's government , which B-MISC is fighting to overthrow . The embassy official said the three men , believed to be in their 20s , were currently in B-LOC I-LOC . He did not elaborate . The B-MISC , working for the B-ORG firm in the B-MISC republic of B-LOC , were taken hostage after a B-MISC B-MISC fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August 1995 . B-MISC said its shipment of ammunition from B-LOC was evidence of B-MISC military support for B-PER 's government . B-LOC said the crew 's nationality was coincidental . Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed . The B-MISC , who said they overpowered the guards -- two armed with B-MISC automatic rifles -- while doing regular maintenance work on their B-MISC I-MISC cargo plane last Friday , left the B-LOC capital B-LOC I-LOC for home on Sunday .

The B-ORG I-ORG agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some B-ORG veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified . B-ORG Farm Commissioner B-PER I-PER had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from B-LOC and B-LOC that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) -- mad cow disease . But some members of the B-ORG 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health . The question is being studied separately by two B-ORG scientific committees . Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to B-MISC which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . B-MISC officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat . B-ORG said B-LOC imported 47,600 sheep from B-LOC last year , nearly half of total imports . It brought in 4,275 tonnes of B-MISC mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports . After the B-MISC government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the B-ORG imposed a worldwide ban on B-MISC beef exports . B-ORG leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as B-LOC takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease . GOLF - SCORES AT B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC .

The former B-MISC champion said the immediate future of B-LOC 's B-MISC I-MISC coach B-PER I-PER could also be determined by events in B-LOC . " If we lose this one , B-PER and I will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go , " B-PER was quoted as saying in B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG newspaper .

Under B-PER 's leadership , B-LOC were relegated from the elite world group last year , the first time the 26-time B-MISC I-MISC winners had slipped from the top rank . Since taking over as captain from B-PER I-PER in 1994 , B-PER 's record in tandem with B-PER , his former doubles partner , has been three wins and three losses . B-PER has selected B-MISC semifinalist B-PER I-PER , B-PER I-PER , B-PER I-PER , and B-MISC doubles champions B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER to face the B-MISC . The home side boasts world number six B-PER I-PER , and B-PER conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the B-MISC number one . " We are ready to fight to our last breath -- B-LOC must play at its absolute best to win , " said B-PER , who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain . B-LOC last won the B-MISC I-MISC in 1986 , but they were beaten finalists against B-LOC three years ago under B-PER 's guidance . BADMINTON - B-MISC I-MISC RESULTS .

He also told B-ORG before the retailer 's annual meeting that the second quarter could be better than the first quarter ended May 4 . " We could do even better , " he said . The second-quarter results are expected to be released in September . B-PER said seeking bankruptcy protection was not under consideration . B-ORG emerged from B-MISC I-MISC bankruptcy protection in June 1994 after 3-1/2 years . " Bankruptcy is always possible , particularly when you lose what we are going to lose in the first half of this year , " B-PER said . " But this is not something we are striving to do . " The B-MISC retailer lost $ 95.7 million in the fiscal year ended February 3 . That was the second-largest loss in the company 's history . B-PER said that B-ORG planned to open two new stores this fall . The company announced in March that it was closing seven stores and backing out of nine new lease agreements . At the time , B-ORG said it did not plan to open any new stores this fall . It currently operates 169 stores in 23 states . For last year 's second quarter , which ended July 29 , 1995 , B-ORG posted a loss of $ 7.1 million , or $ 0.23 per share , on sales of $ 311.9 million . Measles exposure can lead to bowel disease - study . B-LOC 1996-08-23 Women who get measles while pregnant may have babies at higher risk of B-PER 's disease , a debilitating bowel disorder , researchers said on Friday . Three out of four B-MISC babies born to mothers who caught measles developed serious cases of B-PER 's disease , the researchers said . Dr B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC and colleagues screened 25,000 babies delivered at B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC , between 1940 and 1949 .

B-LOC 1996-08-22 Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed , B-MISC researchers have reported . A study by a team of doctors at B-ORG I-ORG has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets . The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels . They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . " There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , " they wrote in the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period . The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate . Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol . But the B-LOC team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short . The six-month trial was funded by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which makes B-MISC brand garlic tablets . The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol . -- B-ORG I-ORG +44 171 542 7950 B-LOC gives aid to volcano-hit B-LOC island . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC said on Thursday it would give 25 million pounds ( $ 39 million ) of development aid to the B-LOC island of B-LOC , where much of the population living in the south has fled to avoid a volcano . The volcano in the Soufriere hills has erupted three times in the past 13 months and last April some 4,500 people living in the capital , B-ORG , and southern areas were evacuated to the north , where many are living in public shelters and schools . " This assistance will provide a fast track development programme for the designated ( northern ) safe area , " B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said in a statement . B-LOC gave 8.5 million pounds ( $ 13 million ) to B-LOC , which is one of its dependent territories , when the volcano first became active . Overseas Development Minister B-PER I-PER said a recent census had shown most B-MISC wanted to remain on the island . " The development of the north will help them to do just that , " she said . Tennis - B-PER looms for B-PER in B-MISC I-MISC . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-22 World number one B-PER I-PER , seeking his first B-MISC I-MISC title of the year , and women 's top seed B-PER I-PER , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year 's final major , which begins on Monday . B-PER opens the defence of his B-MISC I-MISC crown against B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC I-LOC , while top-ranked B-PER begins her title defence against B-PER I-PER of B-LOC . Wednesday 's B-MISC I-MISC draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round . Looming in B-PER 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis B-PER I-PER , the rising B-MISC who took out B-PER in the third round of the B-MISC I-MISC in January . B-PER avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at B-LOC and their rubber match in B-LOC I-LOC could provide some first-week fireworks . While only a stunning upset will keep B-PER from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed B-PER I-PER I-PER , the B-MISC star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran B-PER I-PER of B-LOC . There will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked B-PER I-PER landing in B-PER 's half of the draw . Bumping B-PER up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into B-PER as early as the quarter-finals , but they could lock horns in the semis . B-MISC champion B-PER meets B-PER I-PER of B-LOC in the first round . Surprise second seed B-PER I-PER , ranked third in the world , opens against B-MISC B-PER I-PER , while women 's second seed B-PER I-PER drew B-MISC B-PER I-PER as her first victim . Second-ranked B-MISC B-PER I-PER , who was seeded third , did not have the luck of the draw with him . In the first round B-PER faces B-MISC B-PER I-PER , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late . If he survives , B-PER is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded B-MISC champion B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC or 12th-seeded B-MISC B-PER I-PER in the quarter-finals in B-PER 's half of the draw . Perhaps the best , yet most unfortunate , first-round matchup of the men 's competition pits eighth seed B-PER I-PER against retiring star B-PER I-PER . The popular B-MISC is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion 's B-MISC I-MISC farewell could well be a one-match affair . With the exception of a B-PER showdown , B-PER looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of B-MISC B-PER I-PER and ailing B-MISC I-MISC champion B-PER I-PER , who is nursing a rib injury , in his path . B-PER , runner-up to B-PER last year , is seeded to run into fifth-ranked B-MISC B-PER I-PER in the quarter-finals with fourth seed B-PER I-PER or eighth-seeded B-MISC champion B-PER I-PER looking like her most likely semifinal opponents . But B-PER will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous 18th-ranked B-MISC I-MISC B-PER I-PER . B-PER I-PER , runner-up to B-PER at the B-MISC I-MISC and B-MISC , begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent B-PER I-PER , the 16th seed , before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran B-PER I-PER . B-PER begins play against B-PER I-PER of B-LOC . -- B-ORG I-ORG 61-2 9373-1800 B-ORG - Tennis - B-PER upset , B-PER wins , B-PER loses . B-LOC 1996-08-21 Top-seeded B-PER I-PER of B-LOC was beaten 6-3 7-5 by 123rd-ranked B-PER I-PER of B-LOC on Wednesday in his first match of the $ 2 million B-MISC I-MISC . A lefthander with a strong serve , B-PER kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against B-PER , playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds . The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded B-PER I-PER of B-LOC was beaten 6-7(3-7 ) 6-4 6-4 by unseeded B-PER I-PER of B-LOC . Other seeded players advancing were number three B-PER I-PER of B-LOC I-LOC , number four B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , number six B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC I-LOC and B-MISC B-PER I-PER , the seventh seeed . Eighth seed B-PER I-PER of B-LOC was eliminated in a one hour , 55 minute battle by unseeded B-PER I-PER of B-LOC . B-PER saved a match point at 5-6 in the third-set tie break before winning 6-3 3-6 7-6 ( 8-6 ) . B-PER 's compatriot , 13th seed B-PER I-PER , was not as fortunate . He held one match point at 9-8 in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten 5-7 7-6 ( 7-1 ) 7-6 ( 13-11 ) by unseeded B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC I-LOC . " I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what I was able to do , " said B-PER , who ranks 10th in doubles . There were only two service breaks in the match . The lanky B-MISC broke B-PER at 4-3 in the first set and 5-5 in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the B-MISC hit a service return long . " I probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match , " said B-PER , only partly joking . " The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline . " " He played a good match , took a few chances , and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve . " Playing at night was not B-PER 's preference . " I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match , " he said . " I do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference . " B-PER rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 44th-ranked B-PER , who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot B-PER I-PER in the second round at B-LOC . B-PER hit 32 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24-year-old B-PER . The sixth-ranked B-PER , who lost in the final at B-LOC to world number one B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC last Sunday , made a quick getaway after his loss but did say : " Something was not there when I arrived ( in B-LOC ) . I did n't feel good . And I did n't have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles ( on Tuesday ) . " " I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes , " said B-PER . The 19-year-old B-PER , who beat B-PER in the third round of this year 's B-MISC I-MISC , stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against B-PER . " I 'm pleased because I did n't play that great today , but I fought really well , " he said . " When I was down 2-5 in the tiebreak ( in the third set ) , I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight . Then he shanked a forehand at to make it 5-all and that helped me back . " Soccer - Results of B-MISC I-MISC pro-soccer games .

B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-MISC Major General B-PER I-PER I-PER took over on Thursday as commander of the B-ORG peacekeeping force in B-LOC , two days after the start of the latest ceasefire in the six-year civil war . B-PER replaced another B-MISC major general , B-PER I-PER , who told officers at the handover ceremony that peace was now at hand for B-LOC after six years of fighting and more than a dozen failed accords . " The search for peace in B-LOC has been difficult , challenging and sometimes painful . Peacekeepers were harassed , killed and taken hostage , " he said .

Some guerrillas made villagers listen to propaganda speeches in the village centre , others forced passing motorists out of their cars and daubed their vehicles with slogans . By Wednesday , the whereabouts of the eight hostages was still not known , the sources said . In recent months the B-ORG I-ORG , severely weakened since the 1992 capture of its leader B-PER I-PER , has been stepping up both its military and propaganda activities . B-LOC 's guerrilla conflicts have cost at least 30,000 lives and $ 25 billion in damage to infrastructure since 1980 . Former B-LOC rebel leader held after shooting . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-21 Flamboyant former B-MISC rebel leader B-PER I-PER was in custody on Wednesday charged with attempted murder , police said . B-PER turned himself into police after B-PER I-PER , a B-MISC visitor from the B-LOC , accused B-PER of trying to kill him on Sunday after a bar-room brawl in the small mining town of B-LOC , about 56 miles ( 90 km ) east of B-LOC , said police spokesman B-PER I-PER . B-PER , showing cuts and bruises on his face , told reporters the former head of the feared B-ORG I-ORG had tried and failed to shoot him after B-PER objected to B-PER 's advances toward his wife . B-PER said B-PER then ordered his bodyguards to beat him up . B-PER , 35 , denied the charges and said he had merely defended himself when B-PER attacked him with a bottle . It was the second time B-PER had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years . In 1994 he served two months in prison for shooting a thief in the buttocks . B-PER led a rebel group of about 1,000 in a 1986 uprising against the regime of military strongman B-PER I-PER . The conflict , which killed more than 500 and caused thousands to flee to neighbouring B-LOC I-LOC in the late 1980s , eventually paved the way to democratic elections in 1991 . Despite numerous problems with authorities , B-PER went on to become a successful businessman with mining and logging interests . He also manages and occasionally plays for one of the leading local soccer teams . Noisy saw leads B-MISC police to heroin hideaway . B-LOC 1996-08-22 A B-LOC I-LOC carpenter was arrested in the B-MISC seaside town of B-LOC after police seized 18 kg ( 39.7 pounds ) of heroin following complaints by residents of a noisy saw , police said on Thursday . B-PER I-PER I-PER , 40 , was arrested late on Wednesday after police searched a house and found heroin in bags and hidden in hollow spaces in wooden planks , police said . The suspect said he was hired to make a wooden box from the planks in order to hide the heroin . Police went to the house after receiving complaints of sawing during the night over the course of several days . When they arrived to investigate , police saw people escaping from the back door so they decided to search the house . The seized heroin has an estimated street value of about 300 million baht ( $ 12 million ) , police said . Officials are now hunting for the suspect 's collaborators , police said . B-PER was being detained pending formal charges , police said . B-LOC foreign minister arrives in B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER arrived in B-LOC on Thursday for a four-day visit that follows rising friction between the two nations in recent weeks . B-PER was to meet B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER and sign an agreement on an B-MISC consulate in B-LOC I-LOC , an official of the B-MISC embassy in B-LOC said . B-LOC will resume sovereignty over B-LOC I-LOC , a B-MISC colony , in mid-1997 . Relations between B-LOC and B-LOC have been strained in recent weeks because of B-LOC 's plan to sell uranium to B-LOC 's rival B-LOC . Other issues affecting ties include plans by an B-MISC cabinet minister to visit B-LOC , a security pact between B-LOC and B-LOC and a possible visit to B-LOC next month by B-LOC 's exiled spiritual leader the B-PER I-PER . B-PER is the first B-MISC minister to visit B-LOC since the new conservative government took office in B-LOC in March . B-MISC accuse B-ORG of banning books . B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-22 A B-LOC I-LOC bookseller charged on Thursday that the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of B-MISC self-rule deals . " They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action . One official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to B-LOC ' , " B-PER I-PER , owner of the B-MISC B-LOC bookshop , told B-ORG . He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from B-LOC of a book by B-PER I-PER , a prominent scholar at B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG . B-PER , a B-LOC citizen of B-MISC origin , has been an outspoken critic of the 1993 B-MISC self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord . On Wednesday a bookseller in the B-LOC I-LOC town of B-LOC said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of B-PER 's books on the B-MISC self-rule deals . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Director-General B-PER I-PER denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the B-ORG I-ORG has no plans to censor books . " There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " B-PER told B-ORG . But B-PER said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials . " This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said . B-PER said books by other authors , including B-MISC Journalist B-PER I-PER , were also banned . He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books . " I think this is a bad beginning . If we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? " B-PER said . Thousands of books were banned from sale in the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC by the B-MISC military authorities before the B-MISC state handed over parts of the two areas to the B-ORG under a self-rule deal in 1994 . B-LOC blames B-LOC control tower for accident . B-LOC 1996-08-22 The chairman of national carrier B-ORG on Thursday blamed the control tower at B-LOC airport for the B-ORG plane accident . Twenty people were injured on Wednesday when the B-ORG B-MISC 707 overshot the runway , caught fire , hit a taxi and skipped across a road onto a railway line . Chairman B-PER I-PER I-PER told a news conference at B-LOC airport : " The control tower should have allocated the plane another runway , instead of the one the plane landed on . " " The one it landed on is 2,250 metres ( 2,460 yards ) long while the other one if more than 3,000 metres ( 3,300 yards ) long and is less steep , " he added . He said a B-MISC civil aviation authority official had made the same point and he noted that a B-MISC plane had a similar accident there in 1994 . The B-ORG pilot blamed B-MISC airport staff for misleading him . The landing took place after a rainstorm . " Its not an accident . It 's very wet . The brake action is very poor and the tower said it 's medium . That 's wrong , " the pilot told private B-ORG news agency in B-MISC . B-LOC wants nothing to do with B-MISC rulers . B-LOC 1996-08-22 The B-MISC government will have nothing more to do with the B-MISC government because it continues to shelter and support B-MISC militants , President B-PER I-PER said in a speech on Thursday . B-LOC says the B-MISC government helped the B-MISC militants who tried to kill B-PER in B-LOC I-LOC last year . It sponsored last week 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG resolution threatening a ban on B-MISC flights abroad if B-LOC does not hand over three men accused in the B-LOC I-LOC incident . The sanctions will come into effect in November if B-LOC fails to extradite the men , but B-LOC says it cannot hand them over to B-LOC for trial because they are not in B-LOC . " We are still eager that nothing should affect the B-MISC people but we will not deal with the current regime or the B-PER front or whatever , " B-PER told a group of academics . B-PER I-PER is the leader of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , the political force behind the B-MISC government . " I do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter . There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make B-MISC passorts for them and they get paid by them , " B-PER said . He did not say if B-LOC would go so far as to break relations , a step it has been reluctant to take , ostensibly because it would affect ordinary B-MISC . B-MISC shares shed gains in profit-taking . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-MISC shares ended lower on Thursday , shedding gains of earlier in the week amid profit-taking sales , brokers said . The B-MISC lost 0.19 percent or 123.89 points to end at 64,178.78 . Gains so far this week have totalled 2.92 percent . Daily volume dropped to 7.2 trillion lira from Wednesday 's 7.8 trillion lira . " Profit-taking sales in the afternoon showed the latest gains of the index were actually a reaction rise . I expect the market to go as far down as 63,000 tomorrow if sales continue , " said B-PER I-PER from B-ORG . Brokers said profit taking sales had come especially as the index approached the 65,000 resistance level . They said the index could also rise towards 65,000 if the cheap share prices attracted buyers . The market had its first resistance at 67,000 if it pierced 65,000 , they added . The session 's most active shares were those of B-ORG gained 300 lira to 8,600 . Shares of utility B-ORG lost 3,000 lira to 67,000 . The 85-share industrial index lost 0.47 percent to 70,848.86 and the 15-share financial index rose by 0.55 percent to 55,929.89 . Of the 218 shares traded , gainers outdid losers by 100 to 64 and 54 shares were stable . -- B-ORG I-ORG , +90-212-275 0875 SA B-MISC I-MISC hides behind veil of silence . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC , N.M. 1996-08-22 B-MISC I-MISC , B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER , left B-LOC I-LOC on Thursday , refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title . B-PER , 19 , flew to B-LOC I-LOC after slipping away from the B-LOC I-LOC desert town of B-LOC I-LOC , where she attended the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC pageant on Wednesday . While B-PER was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by B-MISC I-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG to drop 27 pounds ( 12 kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown . In B-LOC , her mother told B-ORG that B-PER had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted . B-PER I-PER insisted her daughter , who weighed 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) when she won the B-MISC I-MISC title in B-LOC I-LOC in May , had perfectly normal eating habits . " Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it 's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said . Organisers flatly denied ever threatening B-PER but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her . Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday 's pageant , B-PER was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage . " Are you kidding ? She 's fantastic , " said B-PER I-PER , 28 , who went to the pageant . " She looked great . Very sexy . " B-PER 's publicists said on Thursday she was scheduled to stay in B-LOC I-LOC for promotional work with sponsors before returning to B-LOC on Sept . 5 . Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in B-LOC and B-PER 's alleged weight problem made front page news this week . It was an official of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG who first said B-PER had been told to lose weight fast . People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat . B-PER I-PER , president of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said he spoke with B-PER to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her . " She 's fine with it . She wished , as we all did , that it had n't happened but she 's spiritually and mentally terrific . There 's no problem whatsoever , " he told B-ORG . He said the lifestyle associated with being B-MISC I-MISC could make routine exercise difficult . " The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout does n't exist . I dont know if B-PER is working out . We have n't talked about it because it has n't been an issue , " he said . B-PER attends third suicide in week . B-LOC , B-LOC . 1996-08-22 Dr. B-PER I-PER attended his third suicide in less than a week on Thursday , bringing the body of a 40-year-old B-LOC woman suffering from multiple sclerosis to a hospital emergency room , doctors said . Dr B-PER I-PER , emergency room director at B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC , said B-PER brought in the body of B-PER I-PER , of B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC . , at midday and told doctors that she had been paralysed by the disease . It was his second assisted-suicide in 36 hours and the 37th that he has acknowledged attending since starting his crusade for doctor assisted suicide in 1990 . B-PER 's lawyer , B-PER I-PER , said those attending B-PER 's death included her husband , B-PER , a police officer , her father , B-PER I-PER , and B-PER . It was the first known time that a police officer has been president at the suicide of one of B-PER 's patients . He offered no details about the cause of B-PER 's death or the location . She was a nurse who had " rapidly progressing multple sclerosis . " On Tuesday night , B-PER attended the death of B-PER I-PER , a 76-year-old B-LOC woman with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or B-PER I-PER 's disease . On August 15 , B-PER helped B-PER I-PER , a 42-year-old B-LOC nurse , who suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome , a non-terminal illness , to end her life .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-22 A B-LOC court sentenced B-LOC B-MISC leader B-PER I-PER on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into B-LOC from his base in the B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER , from B-LOC , B-LOC , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred . " The struggle will go on , " the 43-year-old shouted in B-MISC before being escorted out by security guards . B-PER 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under B-MISC law . The B-MISC government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against B-MISC . B-PER 's worldwide network has been the main source of B-MISC propaganda material flowing into B-LOC since the 1970s . " B-PER possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , " presiding judge B-PER I-PER told the court . " He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at B-LOC . " said B-PER , who also read out extracts from B-PER 's material praising B-PER as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the B-MISC slaughter of millions of B-MISC as a myth . Eager to put B-PER behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor B-PER I-PER limited his charges to offences since 1994 . He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence . Publishing and distributing B-MISC material is illegal in B-LOC but B-PER 's defence team had argued that B-LOC freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland . Interior Minister B-PER I-PER said in a statement he " welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international B-MISC and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications " . " It is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition B-MISC I-MISC said in a statement . B-PER , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark B-MISC black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as B-PER spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision . But as B-PER was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court . " Neither the B-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an B-MISC citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to B-LOC from B-LOC . " That 's the truth . " His attorney , B-PER I-PER , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a B-MISC court could judge someone for actions carried out in the B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER said B-PER was obsessed by B-MISC and devoted his life to leading his B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , which derives its name from the full B-MISC title of B-PER 's B-MISC party . During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the B-ORG 's " B-ORG I-ORG " ( " B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG " ) magazine , filled with references to B-MISC supremacy and defamatory statements about B-MISC . The court rejected B-PER 's argument that B-PER 's extradition from B-LOC , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of B-MISC authorities , was illegal . B-PER was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations . He will probably be free in around two and a half years . The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term . B-ORG official says B-MISC deal will occur " soon " . B-ORG I-ORG 1996-08-22 A senior B-ORG official said on Thursday he expected arrangements to implement the B-MISC oil-for-food deal could be completed " quite soon . " " I am reluctant to speculate but we are doing the preparations and the secretary-general is anxious to start the program , " said Undersecretary-General B-PER I-PER . " It might be sooner than you think , " he told reporters after briefing the B-ORG I-ORG on arrangements for monitors needed to carry out the agreement . B-PER is head of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . His deputy earlier speculated at least 10 days . Suspected killers of bishop dead -- B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-MISC security forces have shot dead three B-MISC guerrillas suspected of killing a leading B-MISC bishop in western B-LOC , the B-MISC state-run television said on Thursday . Security forces also arrested four other men sought for giving support to the slain B-MISC rebels , the television said . The television , which did not say when the security forces killed the rebels , said the four arrested men confessed details of the assassination of the B-MISC B-MISC I-MISC Bishop B-PER I-PER . The 58-year-old B-PER was killed in August 1 in a bomb blast at his residence in the western B-MISC city of B-LOC , hours after he met visiting B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER I-PER in B-LOC . An estimated 50,000 B-MISC and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in B-LOC 's violence pitting B-MISC rebels against the B-MISC government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical B-MISC took a commanding lead .

B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC President B-PER I-PER had to drop the resort of B-ORG from a whirlwind B-MISC tour last year . So B-ORG is going to B-LOC instead . Two residents of the B-LOC resort , where B-PER was to have played golf with the B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER , have been invited to the B-MISC party convention in B-LOC on August 26-29 . They have been asked to bring with them the placards they waved when B-PER addressed B-LOC at a packed ceremony in B-LOC city centre on December 1 , last year . They read : " B-ORG backs B-PER . " " The B-MISC party have requested we bring our placards with us . We will be guests of the B-PER , " said B-PER I-PER , one of the two who have been invited to B-LOC . B-PER made a triumphant B-MISC tour to back a B-LOC I-LOC peace process but was forced to drop B-ORG from a packed schedule at the last minute . B-LOC says B-LOC has promised to observe ceasefire . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC said on Thursday it had received assurances from the B-MISC government that its forces would observe the latest ceasefire in B-LOC . B-ORG I-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER said top B-LOC diplomat B-PER I-PER had been assured by senior B-MISC officials that the ultimatum to storm and take the B-MISC capital of B-LOC was not valid . " The B-MISC side confirmed that the ceasefire is in place and they will keep to it , " B-PER told B-ORG after speaking by telephone to B-PER , who had met the officials on a two-day visit to B-LOC . He returned to B-LOC on Thursday . B-PER is the political director of B-LOC 's foreign ministry . B-PER said he met three B-MISC deputy foreign ministers and a vice defence minister , who confirmed B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER 's pledge that B-LOC would seek a political solution under the aegis of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . " The ultimatum ( to storm B-LOC ) is no longer an issue , " he said quoting B-PER , who had been sent to B-LOC by B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER as his personal envoy to urge an end to B-LOC 's military campaign in the breakaway region . B-PER said the threat of a major assault to take B-LOC had been the unauthorised initiative of the commanding general and not B-LOC 's intention . The officials had been positive about B-PER 's request on Wednesday that President B-PER I-PER 's security chief B-PER I-PER should , on his return to B-LOC , meet B-PER I-PER , the B-ORG representative responsible for B-LOC , he said . B-LOC says sees no arms race with B-LOC , B-LOC . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean B-LOC I-LOC intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring B-LOC and B-LOC . Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER was asked at a news conference if B-LOC 's decision to block adoption of the accord in B-LOC would lead to an arms race with B-LOC and B-LOC . " I do n't see that possibility because B-LOC is not entering into any arms race , " he said . " Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons , particularly nuclear . " B-LOC , along with B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC , is a declared nuclear power . B-LOC carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb . Experts believe both B-LOC and B-LOC could quickly assemble nuclear weapons . B-PER said he did not expect B-LOC 's veto of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations . " I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country . The text has already been blocked , " he said . B-PER said B-LOC would re-examine its position if the treaty , particularly a clause providing for its entry into force , was modified . Asked what B-LOC would do if the pact were forwarded to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , B-PER said : " That bridge I will cross when I come to it . " In a written statement released at the news conference , B-PER reiterated B-LOC 's objections to the treaty , under negotiation at the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC in B-LOC . " It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony , " the statement said . B-PER said B-LOC had national security concerns that made it impossible for B-LOC I-LOC to sign the B-MISC . " Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option , " he said , adding that B-LOC had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country 's lone test blast in 1974 . He said : " We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security " . B-LOC says death of its citizen will sour ties . B-LOC 1996-08-22 A B-MISC minister expressed his government 's official disquiet on Thursday at the recent death of a B-MISC citizen of B-MISC origin at B-LOC airport . " I have told B-LOC leaders that B-MISC goverment has attached serious importance to the resolution of the tragic death of B-PER I-PER , " Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and B-ORG Affairs B-PER I-PER I-PER , told reporters . B-PER I-PER died at B-LOC airport on May 9 during interogation by customs officials after arriving from B-LOC . His body bore multiple injuries , and his relatives complained that he was murdered . A post-mortem report suggested he might have been tortured . But customs authorities said the passenger was drunk and died of loss of blood from a deep cut in his wrist after he hit a glass sheet . B-PER , who arrived in B-LOC on Tuesday on four-day visit , said B-LOC wanted B-LOC to act seriously on the case . " This is one of the reasons of my visit here ... this is an important issue in our relationship " , said B-PER , who is due to leave for B-LOC on Friday . B-PER said the incident had strained relations between the two governments . He said the B-PER 's issue had been raised in the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . B-PER said he had brought up the issue at every meeting he had had with government leaders in B-LOC . He said the B-LOC government had assured him it was taking the matter seriously . " The B-MISC government wants a thorough investigation and a just outcome , " he said . B-PER said the B-MISC government wanted an end to the alleged harassment of its nationals at B-LOC airport by customs officials . B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG has charged two immigration officials in connection with B-PER 's killing . B-PER , a father of five children , had a restaurant business in a B-LOC suburb . B-LOC fears attempts to disrupt B-LOC polls . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-LOC 's Home ( interior ) Minister accused B-LOC on on Thursday of planning to disrupt state elections in troubled B-LOC and B-LOC state . " It seems that from across the border there is going to be a planned attempt to disrupt the elections , " B-PER I-PER told reporters in the state capital B-LOC . The local polls next month will be the first since 1987 in the state , clamped under direct rule from B-LOC I-LOC since 1990 . B-LOC has often accused B-LOC of abetting militancy in the valley , a charge B-LOC has always denied . B-PER said there might be an increase in the number of people infiltrating the B-LOC valley to create disturbance in the region . " We noticed among the people who come from across the border , there is a growing number of foreign mercenaries , " B-PER said . B-LOC and B-LOC have fought two of their three wars over the troubled region of B-LOC since independence from B-LOC in 1947 . Prime Minister B-PER I-PER I-PER 's centre-left government hopes the elections will help restore normality and democratic rule in B-LOC and B-LOC , where more than 20,000 people have died in insurgency-related violence since 1990 . Over a dozen militant groups are fighting B-LOC I-LOC 's rule in the state . B-LOC stocks end up on gains by engineering , banks .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-22 The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG governor B-PER I-PER said on Thursday that he expected the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) maintained by banks to be reduced over the medium term . " Over the medium term , yes , " he told B-ORG after addressing industrialists in the capital . He denied having said in a recent newspaper interview that the CRR could be raised if necessary . He said he was only trying ( in that newspaper report ) to explain the theoretical position on the use of the CRR by central banks to manage money supply . B-PER explained that the cash reserve ratio was an instrument that central banks could use to regulate money supply by reducing or increasing the ratio . But in the current context , the government stood by an earlier commitment to reduce it over a period of time , he said in response to a question . -- B-LOC I-LOC newsroom , +91-11-3012024 Two pct B-LOC current account deficit viable - B-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-22 The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Governor B-PER I-PER said on Thursday that a current account deficit of two percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was sustainable given the currrent rate of growth . " The current account deficit of around two percent of GDP is a sustainable level of deficit given the expected real growth rate and the trends in imports and exports , " B-PER said in an address to business leaders in B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER said a current account deficit of two percent brought about by a 16-17 percent annual growth in exports and a 14-15 percent rise in imports along with an increase in non-debt flows could lead to a reduction in the debt-service ratio to below 20 percent over the next five years . -- B-LOC newsroom +91-22-265 9000 B-PER I-PER devoted to world 's poor . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-PER I-PER , known as the B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER , won the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC in 1979 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor , unwanted people with her simple message : " The poor must know that we love them . " While the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint , the nun of B-MISC descent maintains she is merely doing B-PER 's work . " It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected , " she said . " The poor do not need our sympathy and pity . They need our love and compassion . " The diminutive B-MISC I-MISC missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an B-MISC nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure . But an attending doctor said B-PER I-PER , who turns 86 next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition . The task B-PER I-PER began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated B-LOC , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world . When in 1979 she was told she had won the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , she said characteristically : " I am unworthy . " The world disagreed , showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the B-MISC I-MISC , or B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , the country 's highest civilian award . Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker . A year later , the B-LOC announced she was stepping down as Superior of her B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG order . More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor . They could not agree , so asked her to stay on . She agreed . In 1991 , B-PER I-PER was treated at a B-LOC hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia . In 1993 , she fell in B-LOC and broke three ribs . In August the same year , while in B-LOC I-LOC to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems . Last April she fractured her left collar bone . But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate . B-PER I-PER was born B-PER I-PER I-PER to B-MISC parents in B-LOC , in what was then B-LOC , on August 27 , 1910 . She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 . At the age of 18 she became a B-MISC nun , hoping to work at the Order 's B-LOC mission . She was sent to B-LOC I-LOC in B-LOC and from there to B-LOC to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in B-LOC . She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , 1946 . " The message was quite clear , " she told one interviewer . " I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them . It was an order . I knew where I belonged . " The B-LOC and the mother superior in B-LOC approved and after intensive training as a nurse with B-MISC missionaries she opened her first B-LOC slum school in December 1949 . She took the name of B-PER , after B-LOC 's Saint B-PER of the Child B-PER . In B-LOC she was simply called B-PER . B-PER I-PER set up her first home for the dying in a B-MISC rest house in B-LOC after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital . Named " B-LOC I-LOC " ( B-LOC I-LOC ) , it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 18,000 a year . Her B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a B-MISC I-MISC religious order she founded in 1949 , now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in B-LOC and abroad . In 1994 a B-MISC television documentary called the myth around B-PER I-PER a mixture of " hyperbole and credulity " . B-MISC around the world rose to her defence . B-ORG - FOCUS-News forecasts alien-led profit boost . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-22 Media baron B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on Thursday , but forecast that the hit film " B-MISC I-MISC " would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 . " From an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' B-MISC I-MISC , ' " B-ORG I-ORG said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 30 , 1996 . It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its B-ORG I-ORG television network in the B-LOC I-LOC would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . " A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " B-ORG I-ORG said . The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 . B-ORG announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to B-MISC 1.26 billion ( B-MISC 995 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents . Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of B-MISC 1.343 billion . " The year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , " B-ORG I-ORG media analyst B-PER I-PER said . B-ORG I-ORG said strong performances in B-LOC television and B-MISC newspapers were offset by lower profits from B-ORG I-ORG 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG operations . Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . " Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over B-MISC 300 million , " it said . B-ORG I-ORG said B-MISC newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs . Advertising revenues at B-ORG I-ORG grew 20 percent . Analysts said sharply lower earnings from B-ORG I-ORG 's book publishing division and its B-LOC magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 . B-ORG I-ORG said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the B-LOC B-ORG I-ORG . B-ORG said dramatically lower earnings from the B-MISC arm of its B-ORG publishing division more than offset healthy results from its B-LOC operation . It said the demise of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC had hurt the B-MISC operations , and weak performances from the B-LOC I-LOC unit of B-ORG had not helped . The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out . But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement . " If they 're saying at least 20 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent , " said one B-LOC media analyst who declined to be named . B-ORG I-ORG 's shares were down eight cents at B-MISC 6.39 at 2.00 p.m. ( 0400 B-MISC ) in a soft market .

B-LOC 1996-08-22 The B-MISC government 's plans to slash its budget deficit should make a useful contribution to national savings , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said in its annual report . " The government 's announced plans to balance the budget , if realised , would make a useful contribution to raising national savings , " the B-ORG said . The bank said there were concerns fiscal consolidation would unduly restrict growth , but evidence was ambiguous . In its 1996/97 budget announced on Tuesday , the B-MISC B-ORG government announced an underlying budget deficit of B-MISC 5.65 billion , and pledged to return the underlying budget balance to surplus by 1998/99 . The budget deficit was B-MISC 10.3 billion in 1995/96 . -- B-ORG I-ORG 61-2 9373-1800 " Determined and credible efforts to rein in unsustainable fiscal positions ( are ) often rewarded by rising confidence , giving favourable effects on economic activity even in the short term , " it said . " More generally , the long-term effects of fiscal consolidation are clearly positive , with higher saving tending to promote economic growth by raising investment and lowering long-term real interest rates , " the B-ORG said . B-ORG cuts B-LOC fixed home lending rates . B-LOC 1996-08-22 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Thursday it was cutting its fixed home lending rates .

The company said the increase reflected the value of extensions to the network to meet economic growth in its supply area and an increase in the estimated lifespan of the network . It said the increase was consistent with the approach followed by other power companies and reflected the company 's new levels of preventative maintenance and equipment upgrading .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-LOC celebrates five years of independence from B-LOC rule on Saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main B-MISC achievement . B-LOC 's declaration of independence in 1991 , backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the B-MISC empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from B-LOC . B-LOC , with a B-MISC community of 11 million people -- the world 's largest outside B-LOC -- has avoided conflicts like those in B-LOC 's B-LOC , neighbouring B-LOC , and the former B-MISC republics of B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . " B-LOC 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " President B-PER I-PER said in televised statement this week . " Unlike many other B-MISC countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . " But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround . Inflation -- a hyper-inflationary 10,300 percent a year in 1993 -- was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow . B-PER told a solemn ceremony at the B-LOC I-LOC on Friday that " there was a turning point " in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future . " There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said B-PER I-PER , head of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's mission in B-LOC . " The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . " Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would " definitely " be introduced before the end of this year . It will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the B-MISC rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble . B-LOC has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems . Proud of its record in promptly joining both the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , B-LOC caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending B-LOC by allowing a B-MISC minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit . B-LOC cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest . B-LOC 's Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER said B-LOC was overreacting . But B-LOC , seeing itself as a bridge between B-LOC and the rapidly B-MISC countries of eastern B-LOC , is looking West as well as East . " The strategic aim of B-MISC integration should not in any way damage B-LOC 's interests in B-MISC areas . Relations with B-LOC , which is our main partner , have great importance , " B-PER said . " But B-LOC cannot be economically oriented on B-LOC , even though those in some circles push us to do that . " B-PER has said B-LOC wants membership of the B-ORG I-ORG , associate membership of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG defence grouping and to move closer to B-ORG . A message from the West this week from B-LOC President B-PER I-PER congratulated B-LOC on the anniversary , promising to support market reforms and praising B-LOC as a " stabilising factor " in a united B-LOC . Oldest B-LOC book disappears from B-LOC - paper . B-LOC 1996-08-23 A 16th-century document , the earliest complete example of written B-MISC , has disappeared from the B-LOC archives , an B-MISC newspaper said on Friday . B-ORG I-ORG said the " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ' , by B-PER I-PER , dating from 1555 and discovered in 1740 in a religious seminary in B-LOC , was the first major document published in the B-MISC language . " We B-MISC , sons of B-MISC , believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more , " lamented scholar B-PER I-PER , told of the loss by the B-LOC library . B-LOC 's national library has three copies of the " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ' . " There is nothing left for us but to be grateful to civilisation for inventing photocopies , " B-ORG I-ORG said . B-LOC to clamp down on barter deals . B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-MISC officials , keen to cut capital flight , will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum , a customs official said on Friday . " We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from B-LOC , " B-PER I-PER , deputy head of the currency department at the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , told B-ORG . B-PER said last year goods had been exported under many B-MISC barter deals , with nothing imported in return . She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 . Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all B-MISC exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said . " The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in B-MISC exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , " B-PER said . A few days ago B-MISC President B-PER I-PER issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and B-PER said this " could substantially improve the situation " . In line with the decree , which will come into force on November 1 , all B-MISC barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days . " If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " B-PER said . Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but B-PER said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " . Barter has always been a feature of the B-LOC I-LOC 's foreign trade , but B-PER 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus . A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of B-MISC exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable B-MISC banks and money transfer systems " , B-PER said . " Now many B-MISC banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones . But the current share of barter deals in B-MISC exports is still high , " she said . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG , +7095 941 8520 B-ORG plans " B-MISC " sequel - report . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-22 B-ORG I-ORG is going ahead with a sequel to the B-PER I-PER blockbuster , " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " and hopes to release it in the summer of 1998 , B-ORG I-ORG reported in its Friday edition . The big-screen version of the spy TV series has grossed $ 175 million domestically since opening May 22 , and $ 338 million overseas so far . It 's the biggest success for B-MISC I-MISC B-ORG since 1994 's " B-MISC I-MISC " . However , many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible . B-PER will reprise his roles as star and co-producer , and will soon meet B-MISC I-MISC screenwriter B-PER I-PER , who will write the script , the report said . It said " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " director B-PER I-PER I-PER would have first crack at the sequel , though no deals have been made yet . B-PER , whose B-MISC were for " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " and " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " , earlier this summer criticised some of the season 's blockbusters . However , he singled out " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " as an especially entertaining movie , B-ORG I-ORG said . CRICKET - B-PER FORCED TO SIT AND WAIT . B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-LOC batsman B-PER I-PER was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against B-LOC on Friday . Heavy overnight rain and morning drizzle ruled out any play before lunch on the second day but an improvement in the weather prompted the umpires to announce a 1415 local time ( 1315 B-MISC ) start in the event of no further rain . B-PER , unbeaten on 94 overnight in an B-LOC total of 278 for six , was spotted strumming a guitar in the dressing-room as the B-LOC ground staff took centre stage . There were several damp patches on the square and the outfield and it was still raining when the players took an early lunch at 1230 local time ( 1130 B-MISC ) . When brighter weather finally arrived , the umpires announced a revised figure of 67 overs to be bowled with play extended to at least 1900 local time ( 1800 B-MISC ) .

" It will give the fans something else to look at besides his chest .

TENNIS - B-MISC ADVANCE AT B-MISC I-MISC . B-LOC 1996-08-22 It was B-MISC I-MISC at the $ 2 million B-MISC I-MISC on Thursday as three B-MISC reached the quarter-finals with straight-set victories .

" If you really look at the match , " said the 12th-ranked B-PER after losing to the 70th-ranked B-PER , " I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net . " He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my ( first ) service percentage was only in the 40s . Put those two things together and you get a loss . " B-PER missed 10 weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective . " Before when I was on tour , I always felt I had to be in bed by 9:30 or 10 o'clock and I had to be up at a certain time , " B-PER said . " Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning . I just do n't have as many set routines and it 's made me a happier person . " B-PER was pleased with his victory over B-PER , his first in five meetings with the 11th-ranked B-MISC . " It 's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set , especially against someone you have never beaten , " he said . " I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because B-PER definitely went off a little bit . " The 26-year-old B-PER , who won the B-MISC I-MISC stop in B-LOC I-LOC last week , has now won 18 of his last 20 matches , dating back to qualifying rounds in B-LOC I-LOC in late July . He ranks 76th after being 285th four weeks ago . " I feel I 'm hitting the ball well even though I 'm having more mental letdowns than I did last week , " B-PER said . " But I 'm still competing well . " " I got a lot of first serves in , " said B-PER about his victory over B-PER . " I did n't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes . " Still marvelling at an exciting 64-stroke rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against B-PER I-PER of B-LOC on Tuesday , B-PER joked , " Today against B-PER there were about 64 strokes in the whole match . It was mostly short points . " TENNIS - RESULTS AT B-MISC I-MISC .

In her first mile race at the richest meeting in B-LOC last Wednesday , she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record . The record of four minutes , 12.56 seconds in B-LOC earned B-PER a bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold . After Friday 's performance the B-MISC will have earned well over $ 100,000 in less than a fortnight , taking her appearance money into account . B-LOC organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the B-MISC I-MISC but put down on a softer surface . B-PER clearly enjoyed it . B-PER looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the B-MISC found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead , pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-MISC B-PER I-PER upstaged a trio of past and present B-MISC 100 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the B-LOC grand prix . B-ORG his customary bright green outfit , the B-LOC champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of B-LOC 's reigning B-MISC champion B-PER I-PER , 1992 champion B-PER I-PER of B-LOC and B-MISC 1984 and 1988 champion B-PER I-PER . B-PER also beat world and B-MISC champion B-PER at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in B-LOC last week . The B-MISC , who finished fourth at the B-MISC I-MISC , was fast out of his blocks and held off B-PER 's late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration . The B-MISC was second in 10.09 with B-PER third in 10.10 , ahead of B-LOC bronze medallist B-PER I-PER who clocked 10.12 in fourth . B-PER , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 10.14 . B-PER , making a rare appearance in B-LOC in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp . B-MISC I-MISC high hurdles champion B-PER I-PER defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER . B-PER ran the same time at the B-LOC B-MISC trials in B-LOC in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with B-MISC B-PER I-PER . He seemed to relish the new track at the B-LOC meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back . B-PER , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds . The rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race . But B-LOC 's B-MISC high hurdles champion B-PER I-PER , who crashed out of last week 's meeting in B-LOC after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds . B-MISC silver medallist B-PER I-PER of B-LOC could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 . B-MISC B-ORG champion B-PER I-PER took second in 12.77 ahead of B-MISC B-PER I-PER . The B-LOC fall cost B-PER a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the B-MISC I-MISC series in B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . Seven athletes went into Friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and B-MISC men 's 400 metres hurdles champion B-PER I-PER kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 . B-MISC I-MISC champion B-PER I-PER clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women 's 100 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in B-LOC . B-MISC veteran B-PER I-PER , who beat B-PER in B-LOC after just missing out on the gold medal in B-LOC after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 11.04 . B-MISC world champion B-PER I-PER , the bronze medallist in B-LOC , was second in 11.00 . It was a costly defeat for B-PER since it threw her out of the race for the B-MISC I-MISC jackpot .

Under the agreement , which followed talks in B-LOC this week , B-ORG also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between B-LOC and B-LOC to its B-LOC I-LOC gateway . The B-LOC I-LOC also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years . B-LOC was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current B-LOC I-LOC service , although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . B-LOC would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said . With the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years , the agreement said . The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when B-LOC turned down B-ORG 's request to operate flights between B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC , a denial that prompted the B-LOC I-LOC to charge that the B-MISC were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two B-MISC airlines , B-ORG and B-ORG .

B-LOC 1996-08-23 World number one golfer B-PER I-PER has sacked his coach B-PER I-PER after a disappointing season . " B-PER and I are finished , " B-PER told reporters on Thursday before the start of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC in B-LOC , B-LOC . B-PER , a two-time B-MISC I-MISC champion , parted ways with his long-time mentor after drawing a blank in this year 's four majors , winning two tournaments worldwide . The blonde B-MISC opened with a level par round of 70 in B-LOC , leaving him four shots adrift of the leaders , B-MISC B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER and B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER . On Wednesday B-PER described this year as his worst on the professional circuit since 1991 , when he failed to win a tournament . " My application this year has been strange , " B-PER said . " Maybe I have n't been as keyed up as I should have been . " " Sometimes you do n't have it in your head to play . Maybe this was one of those years where I was there , but I was n't 100 percent there , and you have to be 100 percent to perform , " he said . -- B-ORG I-ORG 61-2 9373-1800 Soccer - B-MISC team breaks new ground in B-LOC . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-23 For the first time in B-MISC history , an B-MISC team will take the field when the B-MISC I-MISC soccer season starts on Saturday . B-ORG I-ORG fields four B-MISC players and two foreign imports -- a B-MISC and a B-MISC . The rest of the side is made up mainly of B-MISC I-MISC . The club , founded in 1961 , has a loyal following in B-LOC , an B-MISC town of 28,000 in the heart of B-LOC . But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse . " The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against B-ORG I-ORG , " said B-ORG supporter B-PER I-PER I-PER . Two weeks ago B-ORG , coached by B-MISC B-PER I-PER , met B-ORG , a club closely associated with the right-wing B-ORG party , for the first time in a B-MISC match in B-LOC . Chants from the crowd of " Death to the B-MISC " , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw . One B-ORG supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium . " We 're used to hearing the taunts of " Death to the B-MISC ' , " said B-PER I-PER I-PER , a B-LOC resident who studies at B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG . " But we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . " The dusty town of B-LOC lacks the amenities of B-MISC communities and many B-MISC I-MISC have long complained of state discrimination . " There are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to B-LOC I-LOC , " 60 km ( 36 miles ) away , B-PER I-PER I-PER said . The town 's ramshackle 2,500-seat ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks . " We plan to build a 10,000-seat stadium , but it may well be situated elsewhere , " said club chairman B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER . " We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . " In the meantime , B-ORG will play all their heavily policed home matches at the B-MISC coastal town of B-LOC . " We are B-MISC , there is no question about that , " said B-PER I-PER I-PER , a hotel waiter . " We do n't have any connection with the B-MISC , they live over there , " he said , pointing to the B-LOC I-LOC seven km ( four miles ) to the east . " We do n't feel our club represents B-MISC I-MISC , " said club chairman B-PER I-PER . " We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit , we are pleased at any support we get , but do not go out looking to represent the whole B-MISC world . " Soccer - B-PER and B-PER both out of B-MISC squad . B-LOC 1996-08-23 Two players have withdrawn from the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC squad for the 1998 B-MISC I-MISC qualifying match against B-LOC on August 31 , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said in a statement on Friday . The B-ORG statement said that B-ORG striker B-PER I-PER and B-ORG defender B-PER I-PER were both receiving treatment for injuries and would not be travelling to B-LOC for the game . No replacements had been named . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG +353 1 6603377 Soccer - B-ORG I-ORG face B-ORG in B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-MISC champions B-ORG will face B-MISC league and cup double winners B-ORG I-ORG in this season 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . The draw made on Friday pitted B-ORG , who beat B-MISC champions B-ORG I-ORG 4-2 on penalties in last year 's final , against B-PER I-PER 's B-MISC hopefuls in group C . The other two teams in the group are last season 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC runners-up B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG of B-LOC . B-ORG meet B-ORG in B-LOC on September 11 , with the return match at B-LOC I-LOC on November 20 . B-ORG have dominated the premier league in the 1990s , winning three B-MISC championships in four years , but have consistently failed in B-LOC , crashing out of the B-MISC I-MISC to B-ORG of B-LOC and B-LOC 's B-ORG at their last two attempts . They have not lifted a B-MISC I-MISC since 1991 when they beat B-ORG in the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC final , and their one and only B-MISC I-MISC triumph was way back in 1968 , when they beat B-ORG of B-LOC 4-1 at B-LOC . B-ORG have won the B-MISC I-MISC twice . Before conquering B-ORG last year they beat B-ORG 's big B-MISC rivals B-ORG in the ill-fated 1985 final in the B-LOC stadium in B-LOC . B-LOC police kill six robbery suspects . B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-MISC police shot dead six robbery suspects as they tried to escape from custody in the northern city of B-LOC , the national news agency reported on Friday .

B-LOC 1996-08-23 Repatriation of 1.1 million B-MISC I-MISC refugees announced by B-LOC and B-LOC on Thursday could start within the next few days , an exiled B-MISC I-MISC lobby group said on Friday . B-PER I-PER , executive secretary of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) which says it has the support of B-LOC 's exiled B-MISC , appealed to the international community to deter the two countries from going ahead with what it termed a " forced and inhuman action " . Orthodox church blown up in southern B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-23 Saboteurs blew up a B-MISC orthodox church in southern B-LOC on Friday with a blast which also damaged four nearby homes , the state news agency B-ORG reported . B-ORG said the church in the small village of B-LOC I-LOC , 30 km ( 19 miles ) north of B-LOC , was destroyed by the morning attack . It did not report any casualties . B-LOC police said in a statement they had launched an investigation and were doing their best to find the perpetrators . B-ORG said it was the first time an orthodox church had been blown up in the B-LOC hinterland , where a large number of B-MISC lived before the 1991 war over B-LOC 's independence from the B-MISC federation . The area was part of the self-styled state of B-LOC proclaimed by minority B-MISC in 1991 and recaptured by the B-MISC army last year . Up to 200,000 B-MISC fled to B-LOC and B-LOC , leaving B-LOC vacant and depopulated . B-LOC 's gross foreign debt rises in June .

B-ORG Minister B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER , B-MISC intelligence co-ordinator in B-PER I-PER 's chancellery , sealed the closer links during talks in B-LOC . Ministry spokesman B-PER I-PER told the B-MISC agency the services would work together against mafia-style groups , drug smuggling and illegal trade in arms and radioactive materials . B-MISC , B-MISC say observing B-LOC ceasefire . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-23 Rebel fighters and B-MISC soldiers said a ceasefire effective at noon ( 0800 B-MISC ) on Friday was being generally observed , although scattered gunfire echoed through the B-MISC capital B-LOC . The B-MISC army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on Thursday . " There has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet , " said fighter B-PER I-PER , a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and camoflage trousers . Soon after he spoke another burst of gunfire rocked the courtyard where the rebels had set up their base and a captured B-MISC B-MISC tank roared out to investigate . The separatists , who swept into B-LOC on August 6 , still control large areas of the centre of town , and B-MISC soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads . " The ceasefire is being observed , " said woman soldier B-PER I-PER , 35 , short dark hair poking out from under a peaked camouflage cap . A few helicopters flew overhead , firing off flares , but there was no shooting from the air . The truce , the latest of several , was agreed in talks on Thursday between B-MISC peacemaker B-PER I-PER and rebel chief-of-staff B-PER I-PER . The two also agreed to set up joint patrols in B-LOC , but B-PER said she was sceptical about whether this could work . " We have to try it , but I doubt if this is possible with the separatists , " she said . WEATHER - Conditions at B-LOC airports - August 23 .

B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-LOC and B-LOC were poised on Friday to sign a landmark normalisation treaty ending five years of tensions and paving way for stabilisation in the B-LOC . B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER landed at B-LOC airport aboard a B-MISC government jet on Friday morning for talks with his B-MISC counterparts and a signing ceremony expected around noon ( 1000 B-MISC ) . On Thursday the B-MISC government endorsed the text of the agreement on normalising relations between the two countries , the B-MISC news agency B-ORG said . " The government assessed the agreement as a crucial step to resolving the B-MISC crisis , ensuring the restoration of peace in former B-LOC , " it said . Last-minute talks this week on the legal fine print finally cleared the way for a treaty based on mutual recognition within internationally recognised borders and the establishment of diplomatic relations , diplomats said . The pact ends five years of hostility after B-LOC 's secession from federal B-LOC . B-MISC powers regard diplomatic normalisation between B-LOC and B-LOC , twin pillars of the old multinational federal B-LOC , as a crucial step towards a lasting peace in the B-LOC . B-LOC president to lunch with ethnic B-MISC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-LOC 's President B-PER I-PER has announced he will hold regular lunches in his presidential palace for members of the country 's different ethnic groups as of next week . " It was about time for the B-MISC , the blacks and the mixed-bloods to begin eating in the palace with their president because this is not a palace exclusively for the potentates and ambassadors and protocol , " B-PER said late on Thursday . " In these weekly lunches we are going to get to know the problems of the B-MISC , mixed-race , black and peasant sectors , " he said . He has invited 35 B-MISC leaders to lunch next Tuesday . B-PER , who was elected on a populist platform last month , also plans to create a ministry for ethnic cultures . The B-MISC nation 's population of 11.4 million is 47 percent indigenous . B-LOC to use hovercrafts for B-LOC travel . B-LOC 1996-08-22 Hovercrafts will soon be plying the waters of the B-LOC in a bid to reduce the difficulties of transportation on the vast B-MISC waterway , the government said on Thursday . Two B-MISC hovercrafts , capable of carrying up to 50 tons each , will begin ferrying passengers and cargo up and down the huge river from its mouth at B-LOC by the end of the year , B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said in a statement . The use of riverways in the region has been made a priority under a government plan for the B-LOC and the high-speed hovercraft will help reduce the time involved in travelling often massive distances , it said . B-LOC 's B-PER to visit B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-23 B-LOC I-LOC Financial Secretary B-PER I-PER will visit B-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC from August 25 to 31 , the government said on Friday .

B-LOC expels B-MISC diplomat after bread riots . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-LOC , which has blamed B-LOC for bread riots last week , has asked an B-MISC diplomat to leave , official and diplomatic sources said on Friday . The main Friday prayers in southern B-LOC that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported . B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC embassy 's press attache , was asked to leave " because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms " , one source told B-ORG , implying he was accused of spying . B-PER told B-ORG by telephone from his embassy office in B-LOC that he " had not been notified " of any explusion order . The government declined official comment . B-PER 's assistant , B-PER I-PER , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King B-PER began calling for change in B-LOC following top B-MISC defections in August 1995 . B-LOC retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the B-MISC embassy in B-LOC but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with B-LOC -- its only secure route to the rest of the world . B-LOC has accused B-LOC and a local B-MISC party for the country 's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . In B-LOC , where two days of riots flared last Friday , a few hundred young men lingered outside B-LOC mosque on leaving , shouting slogans for about 15 minutes . " Disperse , abstain from forming groups and help maintain order , " army officers , who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots , told the crowd through loudspeakers . The men shouted " B-PER Akbar " ( B-PER is Greatest ) as a former B-MISC deputy , B-PER I-PER , told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble . He had earlier mounted the mosque 's pulpit to demand release of detainees , an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises . Armoured cars had patrolled streets in B-LOC , traditional bastion of communist ideology and B-MISC socialism that swept the region in the 1950s , and guarded entrances to the hill-top city famed for its Crusader castle before the prayers . There was also heavy security in the crowded centre of B-LOC , where smaller clashes had erupted last Saturday , but Friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which has one deputy in the 80-seat lower house of parliament , has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship . Government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships . B-LOC says killed 17 B-MISC rebels in clashes . B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-MISC troops have killed 17 B-MISC rebels in recent clashes in the southeast of the country , the state-run B-ORG news agency said on Friday . Two security officials and two state-paid village guards were killed in the fighting with B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) guerrillas , the agency quoted the emergency rule governor 's office as saying . Eight of the rebels were killed in B-LOC province , five in B-LOC and four in B-LOC . The agency did not say when the clashes took place . More than 20,000 people have died in the B-ORG 's 12-year-old fight for independence or autonomy in southeastern B-LOC . Three people , including two village guards , died when a mine planted by B-ORG rebels exploded on a road in the southeast , B-ORG reported earlier . It said a taxi carrying the guards , members of a mostly B-MISC militia which fights the B-ORG , hit the mine in the province of B-LOC . B-LOC says B-MISC I-MISC agree ceasefire . B-LOC 1996-08-23 Leaders of B-LOC 's two main B-MISC factions agreed on Friday to end six days of fighting and to attend B-MISC peace talks next month , the B-ORG I-ORG said . Spokesman B-PER I-PER said in a statement that the agreement followed direct B-LOC contacts with B-PER I-PER , leader of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , and B-PER I-PER , leader of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . B-PER said the two leaders " have agreed to cease the fighting ( and ) return their forces to the positions held before the current fighting began " on August 17 . He did not give a specific time for the ceasefire but said the B-LOC I-LOC looked forward to " immediate implementation " . The two party leaders had also agreed to meet B-LOC Assistant Secretary for B-MISC I-MISC Affairs B-PER I-PER in September " to solidify the cease-fire and to pursue reconciliation " , B-PER said . His statement gave no venue or precise date for the meeting . The B-LOC I-LOC has already called on the B-MISC factions to hold peace talks in B-LOC . The B-ORG said Thursday night it had repelled an attack by thousands of B-ORG fighters , killing , wounding or capturing about 400 opposing guerrillas . The fighting has threatened a B-MISC peace plan to unite the mountainous B-MISC region in northern B-LOC against President B-PER I-PER . One teen left dead by attack on B-LOC slumber party . B-LOC , B-LOC . 1996-08-23 A knife-wielding neighbour apparently intent on sexual assault invaded a teenage slumber party on Friday , killing one girl and wounding three others , police said . At about 4 a.m. EDT ( 0800 B-MISC ) , a group of teenaged girls were having the overnight party in the B-LOC subdivision of this eastern B-LOC city , when a man entered the house , wielding a knife , threatening to sexually assault the girls . Detective B-PER I-PER of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said a neighbour , B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER , 19 , was arrested in the attack , but had not been charged by late morning on Friday . There were apparently no adults at the party as the father of the family who lived in the house was out of town and the mother died more than a year ago , B-PER said . The detective said details were sketchy , but two of the teenagers were reportedly downstairs watching television when B-PER allegedly entered the house and told the girls to take off their clothes . He said a male teenager sleeping upstairs reportedly heard the commotion and came downstairs and confronted B-PER , who allegedly stabbed him more than once . The other teenagers also confronted the assailant and three girls , all under 18 , were stabbed , one fatally . " At least two of them were sexually molested , " B-PER said . He said all of the wounded teenagers were taken to a hospital but none of the injuries were considered life-threatening . Police said the girl who died was identified as B-PER I-PER . Her age was not given . B-PER says B-ORG monitoring aflatoxin in B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-23 Agriculture Secretary B-PER I-PER said the department was monitoring reports of aflatoxin found in corn in parts of B-LOC . " We 're always concerned about aflatoxin but we 're on top of it , " B-PER told reporters after addressing a B-MISC farmers ' market . " That 's a perennial problem . It may be a little more problematic because of cold , wet conditions but we 're on top of it , " the secretary said . Asked about reports B-LOC has set new levels for a vomitoxin in its purchase of B-LOC wheat , the secretary said " I do n't know anything about it " but added that B-ORG officials were " looking at it .

B-PER I-PER is working to stop his bid to win a B-LOC B-ORG seat because she does n't want to leave B-LOC . B-PER conceded his 12-year-old daughter , B-PER , is " a foot soldier " for B-MISC incumbent Sen . B-PER I-PER , even though she is n't old enough to vote . B-PER , speaking on B-ORG radio on Thursday , said he was facing a revolt from his daughter in part because she does not want to leave B-LOC , B-LOC , and move to B-LOC . He also said B-PER I-PER 's best friend , B-PER I-PER , might have something to do with her politics . B-PER is the great-granddaughter of B-MISC former President B-LOC I-LOC , and support for B-MISC runs in the family .

B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-LOC I-LOC said on Friday the B-LOC I-LOC had promised to stamp out any illegal activities on B-LOC soil directed against the island 's government . The B-MISC I-MISC foreign ministry said in a statement : " The B-LOC I-LOC government sympathised with the current predicament B-LOC I-LOC was facing . " The statement said the B-LOC government " would do all within its prevailing legal framework to prevent the use of B-MISC soil to perpetrate violence against the democratic government of B-LOC I-LOC " . It said the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's coordinator for counter terrorism , B-PER I-PER , had expressed B-LOC 's support for the government when he visited B-LOC this week . B-LOC has said it believes B-MISC rebels , fighting a 13-year war for independence against the government , finance their military activity through funds extorted from expatriate B-MISC I-MISC in western countries such as the B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC embassy officials in B-LOC were not immediately available to comment on the report . B-LOC estimates more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war between government forces and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG rebels in the island 's north and east . B-LOC 's king leaves on week-long visit to B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-23 King B-PER left B-LOC on Friday for a week-long visit to B-LOC , his eighth since ascending the throne in 1972 , officials said . The constitutional monarch , who last visited B-LOC in 1993 , was scheduled to meet B-MISC President B-PER I-PER and Premier B-PER I-PER during his visit , they said . Foreign ministry officials gave no details of the issues the king , who was accompanied by Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER I-PER , would discuss with B-MISC leaders . The B-MISC kingdom , sandwiched between B-LOC and B-LOC , has traditionally sought to maintain close cooperation with its giant neighbours , and an equal distance from the two . The 50-year old monarch was accompanied by Queen B-PER on a flight to the B-MISC capital of B-LOC . The king will visit B-LOC before arriving in the B-MISC capital , B-LOC , early next week , officials said . B-LOC man held for keeping child servant in chains . B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-MISC police said on Friday they arrested a man who allegedly kept a child servant bound in chains so that he would not run away when his employer was out to work . B-PER I-PER was arrested on Thursday after his neighbours informed police about the plight of 12-year old B-PER I-PER , who told police his employer used to tie him up with iron chains and locks concealed under his clothes . The neighbours in B-LOC called the police when they saw B-PER , employed by the man for the past nine months , limping because of the chains . " I feared he would flee from work or steal my belongings , " the B-ORG I-ORG newspaper quoted B-PER as saying after his arrest . If convicted , he faces a maximum of three years in jail under B-LOC 's child protection laws . OPTIONS - B-MISC debt vols seen regrouping after fall . B-LOC 1996-08-23 Implied volatility of B-MISC bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's B-MISC cut in interest rates , traders said . " Volatility has come off a lot . We 're looking for it to stabilise now , " said one B-MISC options trader at a B-LOC bank . A trader at a B-MISC bank said B-MISC volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract , 16.75 for December , 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June . This compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of 18.50 for September , 20.00 for December , 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June , he said . At 1347 B-MISC , December B-MISC futures were trading at 96.78 , two basis points down on the day . He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels . He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end . The size of the B-ORG 's repo rate cut , to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent , took markets by surprise . " Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , " he said . " Long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high . " It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit . " He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in B-LOC . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG options specialist B-PER I-PER said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 10-year B-MISC , it should be higher next Tuesday . He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . B-PER said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size . " I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in B-LOC and B-LOC in particular . " With high-yielding markets B-LOC will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts , so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options . " So sell options on B-MISC and B-LOC to enhance yield and buy options on B-LOC , " B-PER said .. -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG +44 171 542 6320 B-ORG I-ORG sets warrants on B-ORG .

B-LOC 1996-08-23 A B-MISC photographer branded a stalker by Princess B-PER has been forced to postpone a legal challenge to a ban on approaching her because he 's been jailed for criminal damage , his lawyer said on Friday . B-PER I-PER started a 12-week jail sentence on Thursday just as he was preparing to contest an injunction obtained by B-PER banning him from coming within 300 metres ( yards ) of her . " We were in the process of preparing a detailed affidavit responding to the Princess 's affadavit and expected to go to court in the next couple of weeks , " said B-PER 's lawyer , B-PER I-PER . " But everything has been put on ice now . " B-PER told B-ORG that the challenge to the injunction would be delayed until B-PER was released . B-PER threw a brick through the window of a van in February after an argument with a driver when he was working as a motorcycle dispatch rider . B-PER , who has previous convictions , is expected to appeal against the sentence . Magistrates also ordered him to pay compensation of 182 pounds ( $ 282 ) . The freelance photographer was branded a stalker by B-PER , whose divorce from heir-to-the-throne Prince B-PER is due to become final next week , after persistently trailing her on his motorcycle . In an affidavit , the princess said that in chasing her B-PER had got so close that he twice smashed into her car and pushed her when she tried to remove the film from his camera . B-PER has rejected B-PER 's claims and said he was being made a scapegoat to scare off press photographers . B-LOC expels B-MISC diplomat . B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-LOC has asked an B-MISC diplomat to leave the kingdom for carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , an official source said on Friday . The move came after B-LOC blamed B-LOC and a B-MISC local political party for last week 's worst unrest in seven years after a government decision to double prices of bread . The government declined comment . " B-LOC has asked Mr. B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC embassy 's press attache , to leave because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , " the source told B-ORG . He said B-PER was still in B-LOC . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship . The riots , which shook B-LOC for two days , broke out after last Friday 's main prayers in the southern town of B-LOC and spread to B-LOC . B-MISC rebels to free B-MISC soldier prisoners . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-MISC I-MISC guerrillas said on Friday they would free seven B-MISC soldiers they hold in northern B-LOC under a tentative B-MISC peace bid . " ...For the sake of safety we are asking for their family members or the authorities to come and pick them up , " B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) central committee member B-PER I-PER told journalists near the B-MISC city of B-LOC . B-ORG guerrillas would accompany the soldiers , captured last spring in one of B-LOC 's frequent cross-border drives , until they could be handed over , he said . Their release has been negotiated by B-MISC writer B-PER I-PER as part of a wider effort , partly backed by Prime Minister B-PER I-PER , to find a political solution to B-LOC 's B-MISC problem . B-PER has encouraged B-PER 's bid but has ruled out direct talks with the rebels . The B-ORG often uses bases in northern B-LOC in its fight for autonomy or independence in southeast B-LOC . More than 20,000 people have died in 12 years of fighting between the guerrillas and B-MISC forces . B-ORG shares mixed on market . B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-ORG shares were mixed on Friday on the privately-operated B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . A shares -- distributed to former holders of property rights in the B-LOC central district B-ORG is rebuilding -- closed at $ 104.625 unchanged from Thursday .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-22 A consortium of telephone companies and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . said Thursday it had signed a $ 1 billion contract with B-ORG to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service . The announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to B-ORG , which has struggled with years of losses . " This really indicates we 're back in the business , " B-PER I-PER , president of the B-LOC , B-MISC company 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said in a telephone interview . " Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . " Following the announcement , B-ORG 's stock soared $ 5.50 to $ 16.875 on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . The consortium , called B-ORG , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment . In addition to B-ORG , B-ORG 's partners are phone companies B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG . B-ORG said B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television . B-ORG also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in B-LOC , B-LOC . , to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets . The company currently buys the tubes from competitors . The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 280 new jobs , B-ORG said . The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years . B-PER said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year . The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis . B-ORG will convert its B-LOC , B-LOC , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes . B-PER declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable . B-ORG will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service . Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics . " We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . " Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong B-ORG presence will pay us dividends in the future . " B-ORG has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 1989 . Last month , it reported a second-quarter loss of $ 33.2 million , or 51 cents a share , vs. a loss of $ 45.3 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier . Last November , B-MISC I-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG bought a majority stake in B-ORG . B-PER I-PER , an analyst for B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . , said the contract was " not unique , but it 's big . " " Digital is coming , it 's economic and the question is what will make the consumer happy and at what price . " B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG says it can meditate problems away . B-LOC 1996-08-22 From the people who brought you hundreds of " yogic fliers " who claimed to defy nature by levitating comes B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on Thursday . At a hotel convention here , the party associated with the B-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) movement named physicist B-PER I-PER as its presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election . The party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress , crime , terrorism and even wars . " Social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease , " said a party paper . Many party members are practitioners of B-MISC , which involves meditating to a repeated word or phrase , called a mantra . Some advanced B-MISC followers contend they can actually mediate to such a point that they fly . But in a demonstration of " yogic flying " several years ago , critics said the people were merely bouncing off the ground from a sitting position . Huge B-MISC I-MISC sales fail to meet expectations . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-22 A year after its massively publicized introduction , B-ORG I-ORG 's B-MISC I-MISC computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry . Even though more than 40 million copies of B-MISC I-MISC have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers . The B-PER , B-MISC company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and lighting B-LOC I-LOC 's B-LOC I-LOC building in a B-MISC color scheme . But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because B-ORG delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said . " It did n't do as well as it could have , " said B-PER I-PER , an analyst with B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized . " People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said B-PER I-PER , an analyst with B-ORG I-ORG . " It 's not as though it has n't had an impact , " he said . " It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . " B-ORG I-ORG , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the B-MISC I-MISC launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the B-MISC I-MISC launch . Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of B-MISC I-MISC , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said B-PER I-PER , president of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . To be sure , sales of B-MISC I-MISC and the accompanying B-MISC I-MISC upgrade drove B-ORG sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company . B-ORG executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of B-MISC I-MISC will surpass that of the older version of B-MISC , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide . But B-PER said the figure could have been even higher if B-ORG had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system . He and other analysts said corporate B-LOC adopted a go-slow approach because B-ORG already was promoting the new version of its high-end B-MISC I-MISC operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks . " B-ORG sent a lot of signals that B-MISC was going to be the answer , " B-PER said . " Many people began to believe that B-MISC I-MISC was being downplayed . " But now that B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC has been launched , B-PER and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of B-MISC I-MISC . " B-MISC I-MISC is going to do great , " he said . " The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . " B-LOC says still committed to B-LOC migration pacts . B-LOC 1996-08-22 The B-LOC I-LOC said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with B-LOC and would continue to repatriate intercepted B-MISC migrants who attempted to enter B-LOC territory illegally . A B-ORG I-ORG statement appeared in part a response to B-MISC complaints that B-LOC was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the B-MISC involved in recent illegal migration incidents . " The B-LOC I-LOC reiterates its full commitment to the implementation " of the accords signed by the two countries in 1994 and 1995 , said the statement by spokesman B-PER I-PER . " The B-LOC I-LOC will continue to return B-MISC migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the B-LOC I-LOC or the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC illegally , " it said . B-LOC would also take " prompt and effective law enforcement action " against alien smuggling and hijackings from B-LOC , it added . B-PER told reporters the statement would be distributed in the B-MISC exile community in B-LOC " to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits " from B-LOC to B-LOC . B-LOC 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the B-LOC I-LOC last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from B-LOC . Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to B-LOC but eight were taken to the B-LOC I-LOC and three to B-LOC I-LOC , a B-LOC base on B-LOC , until they emigrated to another nation . The most recent hijacking , last Friday , involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft . B-PER said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to B-LOC but B-LOC authorities planned to try the hijackers . In an incident on July 7 , a B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG official hijacked a commercial plane and sought aylum at B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER said he knew of no plans to return the man to B-LOC . B-LOC . says is first state to apply for new welfare . B-LOC 1996-08-22 In keeping with its pioneering image in the area of welfare , B-LOC was the first state to submit an administrative plan under the nation 's new welfare law , Gov . B-PER I-PER said Thursday . According to a new release from the governor , B-LOC submitted a plan to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after President B-PER I-PER signed the measure into law Thursday . " As the nation 's leader in welfare reform , B-LOC is far ahead of the curve and ready to go under this new system , " B-PER said . Still , the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state 's own welfare reform program , dubbed B-MISC . He said that despite the new law , B-LOC will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state , a 60-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program , and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents . The nation 's new welfare reform law limits eligibility , gives states more power and ends direct federal aid for poor children . -- B-PER I-PER , 312-408-8647 Snoozing B-MISC man takes slow train to B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-22 A B-MISC man who tried to take a snooze in a railway boxcar in B-LOC found himself locked in and bound for B-LOC with no food or water . Officials in the port of B-LOC said on Thursday that they found B-PER I-PER I-PER , 29 , dehydrated , famished and terrified after sailing to B-LOC from B-LOC in the boxcar loaded on a barge , a trip that takes about five days . Sgt . B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC , B-LOC police department described B-PER as " extremely cooperative " . " Seeing me in my uniform , he kept saying , Jail better . Jail better .

" He had climbed up in this boxcar to get out of the weather and to get some sleep , " B-PER said . " The next thing you know , the boxcar is coupled up and loaded up to a barge and headed north . " Police found B-PER late on Monday when the boxcar , which was transporting lumber , was opened at B-LOC , a port in western B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC . Officials fed B-PER some soup , gave him medical care , kept him overnight and then fed him a large breakfast . State , federal agents probe B-LOC church fires . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC . 1996-08-22 State and federal agents on Thursday sifted through the rubble of two predominantly black B-LOC churches that burned within minutes of one another late Tuesday and early Wednesday . Both churches were in the B-LOC delta region of B-LOC , about 90 miles ( 145 kms ) southeast of B-LOC I-LOC , and were located within three miles of one another . " We 're investigating with the idea that both fires may be arson , but that has n't been conclusively established , " said B-PER I-PER , a spokesman for the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Agents of the B-ORG and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG were also at the scene , B-PER said . B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC were both frame structures , each near B-LOC , B-LOC , a small community surrounded by cotton and soybean fields . " This is rural B-LOC . I 'm surprised anyone could even find us out here , " said B-PER I-PER , a member of B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC , who said she believed arson was to blame .

B-LOC copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-23 Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in B-LOC bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to B-LOC 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday . Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of B-LOC , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said . Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into B-LOC by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) in June and July . It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , owned the copper . Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise . But one source , the head of a B-LOC I-LOC trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not . " If they spend all this money moving the copper to B-LOC , it will be sitting there for years , " he said . " Once it arrives in B-LOC , it is subject to monitoring by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said . Mystery has surrounded the B-LOC stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it . Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price . B-ORG lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the B-ORG between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously . Traders in B-LOC said B-ORG could well have lent it to the market at around B-MISC 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year . This would have cleared B-ORG a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs . Word that B-ORG had offered the copper to B-MISC trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market . Industry analysts B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market . B-ORG repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by B-ORG I-ORG , with B-ORG said to be helping the B-MISC trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals . B-ORG and B-ORG have made no comments on the talk and B-MISC traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement . Traders in B-LOC said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the B-LOC bonded warehouses . They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases . They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market . But these concerns were irrelevant , a B-LOC trader said , despite a forecast that domestic B-MISC copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year . As with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the B-MISC government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . " You do n't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency .

B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-ORG are set to step up their B-MISC county championship challenge with a fifth consecutive victory after new-ball pair B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER sent B-ORG reeling on Saturday . B-PER seized two wickets in two deliveries and left-armer B-PER also captured two as B-ORG , 252 behind on first innings , slumped to 27 for four at the close on the third day of the four-day game at B-LOC . B-ORG , who started the current round of matches in fifth place 20 points behind leaders B-ORG with a game in hand , could go top if they complete victory on Monday 's last day and other results favour them . B-PER thrust B-ORG on course for success by dispatching B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER in his second over , before B-PER removed B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER to reduce B-ORG to 17 for four at one stage . The visitors had started the day optimistically by sending back former B-LOC captain B-PER I-PER when he added just six to his overnight 105 , but B-ORG went on to make 532 for eight before declaring . Captain B-PER I-PER plundered 88 from 73 deliveries , hitting 15 fours and one six . Second-placed B-ORG were frustrated by rain which prevented any play at B-LOC , where they have reached 255 for three in their first innings against B-ORG , while third-placed B-ORG are facing an uphill task against B-ORG . B-ORG slipped to 88 for four in reply to B-ORG ' commanding first innings of 446 for nine declared at B-LOC I-LOC , before B-PER I-PER struck a 55-ball half-century . B-PER 's 56 not out , containing eight fours and three sixes , lifted B-ORG to 128 for four on a rain-curtailed day . Fourth-placed B-ORG had B-ORG on the ropes at B-LOC before rain intervened . Pace trio B-PER I-PER ( 2-24 ) , B-PER I-PER ( 3-20 ) and B-PER I-PER ( 2-19 ) had B-ORG reeling at 81 for seven in reply to the home county 's first innings of 353 . B-ORG rekindled their title hopes after three successive defeats by taking the upper hand against arch-rivals B-ORG at B-LOC I-LOC . Facing B-ORG 's 529 for eight declared , B-ORG were forced to follow on 206 behind after being bowled out for 323 , paceman B-PER I-PER polishing off the innings with a burst of three wickets for one run in 17 deliveries . B-ORG then reached 210 for five at the close -- just four ahead -- after B-PER I-PER hit 55 in 60 balls to add to his first innings of 86 . CRICKET - B-LOC V B-LOC FINAL TEST SCOREBOARD .

B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-ORG 's early season teething problems continued on Saturday when they lost 2-1 at home to premier league pacesetters B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC striker B-PER I-PER gave B-PER I-PER 's talent-laden side the lead from the penalty spot after 13 minutes after Wednesday 's B-MISC B-PER I-PER pulled down B-MISC forward B-PER I-PER . But two minutes later B-ORG equalised through B-PER I-PER , who found space in the penalty area to meet B-PER I-PER 's free kick with a precise glancing header . B-PER I-PER stole three points for the B-ORG side with a goal 10 minutes from time . To add to B-ORG 's misery , B-LOC striker B-PER I-PER was stretchered off in the second half . B-ORG , who escaped relegation on the final day of last season , have now won their first three games of the season . Elsewhere , title hopefuls B-ORG were held 0-0 at home by newly-promoted B-ORG , and in B-LOC , the tie between B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG also ended goaless .

B-ORG , without injured defenders B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER and strikers B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise . But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes B-MISC striker B-PER I-PER I-PER rushed out of his own half , beat the B-ORG defence and lobbed B-PER I-PER I-PER . The defeat means B-ORG 's main title contenders B-ORG I-ORG , who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat B-ORG on Sunday .

B-LOC 1996-08-24 The one-day match between B-LOC I-LOC and a B-ORG I-ORG was abandoned on Saturday because of rain . Scores : B-ORG I-ORG 102-0 ( B-PER I-PER 39 not out , B-PER I-PER 56 not out ) off 21.4 overs v B-LOC I-LOC . B-MISC hostage in B-LOC describes ordeal . B-LOC 1996-08-24 A B-MISC aid worker , held hostage in B-LOC for nearly four weeks , said on Saturday a cocked B-MISC had been thrust into his mouth at one point during his ordeal . B-PER I-PER , a 23-year-old worker with the group B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , described his ordeal to a news conference when he arrived back in B-LOC from B-LOC . " The worst period of physical manhandling was during that time when we were beaten with B-MISC and at one point I had a B-MISC held to the back of my throat -- cocked , " he said . " For the first period we were held in a small room with no bed or anything . We had very little food and sometimes went two or three days without eating . " Gunmen seized B-PER , who comes from B-LOC in southern B-LOC , B-MISC B-PER I-PER and six other hostages from their car in B-LOC , the capital of B-LOC , on July 27 . The assailants had demanded a ransom of 300,000 pounds ( $ 465,000 ) but no money was paid by the charity when they were released on Wednesday . The hostages were held in a house in or near B-LOC which was bombarded regularly . " During the last 15 days of being held , the fighting in B-LOC was very close . At first it was street fighting outside the house and then we came under very heavy shelling and bombardment from conventional weapons like tanks , artillery and grenade launchers , " he said . B-PER had been working for the charity which provides food to civilians for only a few weeks before he was captured . When asked if he would return to the mountainous region where rebels have been fighting B-MISC troops for full independence , B-PER said : " Not for the time being . I do n't think it 's safe for me . But maybe in the future , depending on the circumstances . " Princess B-PER send message to B-PER I-PER . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-LOC 's Princess B-PER has sent a message to seriously ill B-PER I-PER , the nun to whom she has turned several times for spiritual guidance . B-PER 's office said on Saturday the princess had sent a message to the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC missionary as news broke this week of her battle against heart problems and malaria . A spokeswoman declined to release details of the message . B-PER first met the B-MISC missionary in B-LOC in 1992 . She said afterwards that the meeting had fulfilled her " dearest wish " and the two women have met several times since . The princess , who has carved out a major role for herself as a helper of the sick and needy , is said to have turned to B-PER I-PER for guidance as her marriage crumbled to heir to the B-MISC throne B-PER I-PER . The 85-year-old nun said in the past that she was praying for the couple , whose divorce is expected to become final next week . Doctors caring for B-PER I-PER in a B-LOC hospital said on Saturday that her fever had fallen and her malaria was under control but she remained on a respirator in intensive care .

B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-24 About 350 adventurers from nine countries set out on Saturday to climb , raft , bike and run in a 323-mile ( 517-km ) endurance race through the B-MISC wilderness . The event , called the B-MISC , is part of a growing sport known as adventure racing in which competitors test their limits for days over a perilous wilderness course . " I 'm looking forward to this race . I think it will be more physically challenging and we 'll have to go up against more diverse situations due to the terrain , " said Dr. B-PER I-PER , a veteran B-MISC participant . The B-MISC has been staged twice before -- in B-LOC and B-LOC last year -- and is modelled on similar races overseas . The 70 teams in this year 's race will will trek glaciers , climb mountains , whitewater raft , horseback ride , canoe and mountain bike along the grueling course . This year 's race , the route of which was keep a secret until Friday evening , is being held near B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC , about 100 miles ( 160 km ) northeast of B-LOC . The area is filled with treacherous mountain peaks , ice fields and frigid waters . Organisers expect about two-thirds of the participants to drop out or be disqualified before the finish . The hardy ones are expected to complete the course in about six days , with first-place finishers receiving $ 10,000 in prize money . In the B-MISC , competitors race in teams of five which must include both men and women . Team members must remain within 100 yards ( metres ) of each other at all times and finish together . With racers carrying about 40 pounds ( 18 kg ) of gear on their backs , broken bones , sunstroke , dehydration and exhaustion are common . Cholera kills 21 in southern B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-05-28 An outbreak of cholera has killed 21 people in a week at B-LOC in oil-rich southern B-LOC , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG reported on Saturday . The chairman of the local council , B-PER I-PER , said drugs had been rushed to the area to quell the disease and the community needed a safer source of drinking water to prevent future outbreaks . Epidemics are common in rural areas of B-LOC where piped water is not usually available . B-LOC 's ex-president B-PER says he 's feeling well . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-LOC 's frail former president , B-PER I-PER , said on Saturday in a rare public interview that he was feeling well despite his advanced years . " I feel all right and I eat everything that is put on the table . And that means I am all right , " he told reporters invited to his home . B-PER , a vegetarian teetotaller believed to be 97 , walked unaided but supporting himself on a walking stick . He clutched a fly whisk which for a long time symbolised his obsession with power . His health was the subject of much recent speculation . B-LOC 's undisputed ruler for three decades , he lost power in the first all-party elections in 1994 . He spent a year under house arrest and was tried but acquitted last year on charges of ordering the murder of four opponents in 1983 . B-LOC fires striking civil servants . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-24 The B-MISC government fired thousands of workers on Saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said in a statement that the workers -- including nurses , junior doctors , mortuary attendants , customs officers and firefighters -- would be barred from entering their workplaces on Monday . " All civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours , and remained working for the full working day on 23 August 1996 , have been summarily dismissed ... with immediate effect , " it said in a statement . Union officials from the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) were unavailable for comment . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Minister B-LOC Chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers , sub-contracting some of the work to private firms . The government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on Tuesday , saying it was illegal . But the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of 30 to 60 percent were met . The stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the B-ORG I-ORG . It has also disrupted flights . Some internal services were cancelled , leaving tourists at the B-LOC I-LOC resort stranded , and flights abroad were delayed . The B-ORG said 80 percent of the country 's 180,000 civil servants took part in the strike which is a rare challenge to President B-PER I-PER , who has been in power since independence from B-LOC in 1980 . Opposition parties , civic organisations and private-sector unions have expressed support for the action and denounced the government 's pay rises of up to eight percent for its workers . Civil servants earn on average B-MISC 1,000 ( $ 100 ) a month . They say their pay has not kept up at all with inflation , currently running at 22 percent . B-LOC says B-LOC expels 28 B-MISC refugees . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-LOC said on Saturday that B-LOC had expelled 28 B-MISC B-MISC refugees accused of being " trouble-makers " in camps in eastern B-LOC . Captain B-PER I-PER , spokesman for the B-MISC B-MISC army , told B-ORG in B-LOC that 17 of the 28 refugees handed over on Friday from the B-MISC town of B-LOC had been soldiers in the former B-MISC army which fled to B-LOC in 1994 after being defeated by B-MISC forces in B-LOC 's civil war . B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER I-PER said on Thursday in a visit to B-LOC that his country would expell all the refugees back to B-LOC but he gave no timeframe . B-LOC is home to 1.1 million B-MISC B-MISC refugees who fled three months of civil war in 1994 . Many had taken part in the genocide that year of one million people , mostly B-MISC , and refuse to go home for fear of reprisal at the hands of the new B-MISC government in B-LOC . B-PER said the refugees were handed over following a deal made at a meeting between the governor of B-LOC 's north B-LOC region and his counterpart in the B-MISC border town of B-LOC . " After a meeting between the governor of north B-LOC and the prefect of B-LOC , 28 prisoners ( refugees ) were handed over to B-MISC authorities on Friday , " B-PER said . " Out of these 17 were former soldiers . These people are now in B-LOC prison , " B-PER added . Revered skull of B-LOC I-LOC king is B-MISC woman 's . B-LOC 1996-08-24 A limelight-loving B-MISC I-MISC chief was in disgrace on Saturday after a prized skull he brought home from B-LOC was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor , but to a middle-aged white woman . A forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of 19th century King B-PER , a chief of President B-PER I-PER 's B-MISC tribe killed in battle by the B-MISC , said it was in fact the cranium of a B-MISC woman . Chief B-PER I-PER , dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia , journeyed to a wintry B-LOC in February on a hugely publicised quest to find B-PER 's skull . The witchdoctor said ancestors had appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to return the head , said to have been carried off as a colonial trophy by the officer who shot and allegedly beheaded B-PER after a battle in 1835 . But B-PER ran into trouble as soon as he returned to B-LOC I-LOC with a skull he found in a cottage in a lonely B-LOC forest near B-LOC . He said the spirit of a hurricane had guided him there . Members of the B-MISC royal family , branding B-PER a charlatan , confiscated the head and sent it for tests to a forensic scientist , who examined the shape of the skull and the hole that he determined had not come , as supposed , from a bullet . " It can be stated beyond reasonable doubt that this skull is not that of the late king , " the scientist said in a statement . B-LOC arrests opposition sewing machine smugglers . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-MISC police have arrested three people trying to smuggle sewing machines and army clothing to B-MISC opposition groups in B-LOC , an official newspaper reported on Saturday . The government-owned B-ORG I-ORG said the smugglers were caught in B-LOC in the eastern state of B-LOC , on the border with B-LOC , and had confessed they were on their way to " the so-called alliance forces which have been undertaking subversive operations on the eastern border " . Authorities in B-LOC said opposition forces based in B-LOC have been laying landmines and stealing vehicles and other goods to smuggle them across the border into B-LOC . B-LOC accuses the B-MISC authorities of providing support to B-MISC opposition elements based in B-LOC . B-LOC cut diplomatic ties with B-LOC in 1994 , accusing it of training rebels to make raids into B-LOC . The exiled B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a B-MISC umbrella opposition group , has its headquarters in the B-MISC capital B-LOC . It uses the former B-MISC embassy . B-MISC Socialists start landmark reform congress . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-LOC 's opposition B-ORG I-ORG began a two-day congress on Saturday to discuss major jettisoning its links with almost half a century of B-MISC dictatorship in the B-LOC country . " The congress will approve new concepts that will turn the party into a Social-Democratic and electoral party , not a class and ideological one , " the Socialist B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG daily said in an editorial . Jailed Socialist leader B-PER I-PER made the first call for change in July , a month after the party 's chief opponents , the conservative B-MISC of President B-PER I-PER , almost swept the board in a disputed general election . The Socialists , reformed heirs to the communists , pulled out of the poll saying it was a sham . Acting Socialist leader B-PER I-PER has said he too will urge the party to scrap the ideas of B-PER I-PER at the congress . The pro-reform stance of some of the party leadership initially caused a storm and triggered the resignation last month of the party 's Secretary-General B-PER I-PER . More recently political commentators have reported a growing consensus , however , and a rift at the meeting looks increasingly unlikely . B-MISC president to go to B-LOC for medical care . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-23 B-MISC President B-PER I-PER was due to fly to the B-LOC I-LOC on Saturday for a medical check-up to determine if surgery was needed on the lower part of her spinal column , the government said on Friday . B-PER has complained of lower back pain since her trip to B-LOC in May , when the pain forced her to go to B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC for an examination . B-PER , 66 , suffers from osteoporosis , a disease that weakens the bones , and has repeatedly flown to B-LOC for treatment by her longtime doctor , B-PER I-PER . B-LOC wo n't help split B-LOC , king tells B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-24 King B-PER of B-LOC has told B-LOC his nation will not become the tool of people who want B-MISC independence from B-LOC , the official B-ORG I-ORG newspaper said on Saturday . King B-PER , in B-LOC at the start of a one-week unofficial visit to B-LOC , said the B-MISC government had " maintained a sharp vigilance against such intentions " , the newspaper said . B-LOC shares a long mountain border with the restive B-MISC region , where opposition to B-LOC 's four-decade rule is widespread . B-MISC official media has often accused foreign forces , notably the B-LOC I-LOC , of seeking to support B-MISC independence activists . King B-PER told B-PER I-PER , chairman of the B-MISC government , that B-LOC would not " become a tool for others to split B-LOC " , the newspaper said . B-PER told the royal visitor increased cooperation between B-LOC and B-LOC was possible in the fields of trade , tourism , communications and sports , it said . It gave no details . B-LOC hangs two men for drug trafficking . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-LOC has hanged two drug traffickers in the southern city of B-LOC , the evening newspaper B-ORG reported on Saturday . The two B-MISC men were arrested in July with 419 kilograms ( 924 lbs ) of opium after they opened fire on police and killed a pedestrain and wounded four , the newspaper quoted a police commander as saying . B-ORG said the executions were ordered by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . It did not say when they took place . One of the men , who killed the pedestrian , was hanged at the site of the crime and the other was executed in B-LOC prison in B-LOC , the newspaper said . Possession of 30 grammes ( just over an ounce ) of heroin or five kg ( 11 lb ) of opium is punishable by death in B-LOC . More than 1,000 people have been executed in drug-related cases since the law took effect in 1989 . B-LOC has an estimated one million drug addicts and is a key transit route for drugs , mostly opium , smuggled to B-LOC through B-LOC and B-LOC -- the so called " B-ORG I-ORG . " Main B-MISC opposition party ousted from HQ . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-LOC 's main opposition party on Saturday announced that it had been ousted from its headquarters building by a court decision for failing to pay the rent . B-PER I-PER I-PER , spokesman for the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said that a bailiff who was accompagnied by policemen , on Saturday ordered the party to leave the building . " We were not allowed a delay to enable us to transfer the movement 's goods and documents , " B-PER added in a statement . The building is state property . The B-ORG was represented in court and admitted owing money for rent but did not give details . B-ORG this year lost its president and vice-president , both of whom were tried and given jail sentences . B-ORG president B-PER I-PER was sentenced last February to 11 years in jail on charges of having secret contacts with B-MISC agents and receiving money from B-LOC . Vice-president B-PER I-PER last July was sentenced to five years in prison on a charge of disclosing secrets of judicial proceedings in B-PER 's affair . To replace B-PER , the B-ORG after the trial named B-PER as " coordinator " but B-PER I-PER , the last of the B-ORG founding members still politically active , claimed the title of president , causing a new split within the movement . B-ORG was founded in 1978 by a group led by B-PER I-PER , who withdrew from politics in 1992 . Succeeding him as head of the movement , B-PER , an B-MISC nationalist , ousted liberals led by B-ORG secretary-general B-PER I-PER I-PER in 1993 . B-MISC group says two killed in B-MISC shelling . B-LOC 1996-08-24 An B-MISC I-MISC guerrilla group on Saturday accused B-MISC government forces of killing two civilians in shelling in northern B-LOC , the B-MISC news agency B-ORG reported . B-ORG said it was monitoring a report from a radio station affiliated to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . " B-MISC army heavily shelled the B-LOC I-LOC camp , west of B-LOC , on Friday ... Two civilians were killed in the B-MISC bombing , " B-ORG quoted the radio report as saying . The B-MISC radio on Friday said B-MISC heavy artillery was pounding its positions in B-MISC northern B-LOC but it gave no details of casualties . There was no independent confirmation of the reports . The rival B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , which accuses B-LOC of supporting the B-ORG , said on Thursday that its forces had halted an Iranian-backed attack by thousands of B-ORG fighters . The B-LOC I-LOC said in B-LOC on Friday that it had brokered a ceasefire to end six days of fighting between the two main B-MISC factions and persuaded them to attend B-MISC peace talks next month . The clashes , shattering a ceasefire negotiated last year by B-LOC , had threatened a B-MISC peace plan to unite the B-MISC region against B-MISC President B-PER I-PER . B-LOC , B-MISC and B-MISC planes have been patrolling the skies of northern B-LOC since shortly after the 1991 B-MISC I-MISC to shield B-LOC 's B-MISC from any attack by B-MISC troops . B-LOC accuses B-LOC of ceasefire violations . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-LOC has accused B-LOC of violating the ceasefire ending their 1980-88 war some 32 times between the end of March and May 31 this year , the B-MISC news agency B-ORG reported on Saturday . B-LOC 's deputy representative to the B-ORG I-ORG , B-PER I-PER I-PER , made the allegations in a letter to B-ORG Secretary-General B-PER I-PER on Friday , the agency said . " The B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC has reported some 32 new cases of ceasefire violations by the B-MISC regime between March 31 and May 31 , 1996 , " it reported from B-LOC I-LOC . It said violations included constructing observation posts , installing mortars and anti-aircraft cannons , setting up tents , penetrating B-MISC territory , and firing rifle grenades towards B-MISC territory . The eight-year war between the two countries ended with a B-MISC ceasefire . PRESS DIGEST - B-LOC - Aug 24 . B-LOC 1996-08-24 These are some of the leading stories in the official B-MISC press on Saturday . B-ORG has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy . B-ORG - B-LOC chamber of commerce urges B-LOC to resume trade with B-LOC . - Offers from B-MISC and foreign companies to supply B-LOC with goods . - Four ships unload tonnes of B-MISC sugar at B-LOC 's B-LOC . - Editorial blames B-LOC for latest flare-up of fighting between B-MISC rebels in northern B-LOC . - Black market booms in the shadow of state-run supermarkets . - Parliament completes draft law on protection of river waters in B-LOC . B-ORG - B-LOC denounces violation of airspace by B-LOC warplanes . B-LOC - Editorial lambasts B-PER I-PER , leader of a B-MISC rebel faction in the north , for liaising with B-LOC in its fight against rivals . B-ORG - Blaming B-LOC for riots in B-LOC is a dirty game . B-PER campaign busy making " news " . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-24 President B-PER I-PER has served notice he intends to be busy " making news " -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year . With B-MISC gathering in B-LOC to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , B-PER plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded B-MISC conclave that gave a boost to rival B-PER I-PER . After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the B-MISC B-ORG , B-PER used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly " announce " a development in the war on crime . " Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , " B-PER said . " That plan has now reached my desk . " " Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , " he said . Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without B-PER lifting a finger . Attorney General B-PER I-PER 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the B-ORG until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established . Two months ago , B-PER announced he wanted an interim effort established . Now , 60 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again . It is an example of B-PER 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election . Such things do not happen by chance in the B-PER B-LOC I-LOC , they are part of his political chess game . In the past week B-PER signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system . " B-LOC can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , " B-PER said , without even a passing reference to the B-MISC majority in the B-ORG and B-ORG . " B-LOC is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , " he said in striking the theme of his coming week . According to a senior campaign official , B-PER " will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . " B-PER departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC while fellow B-MISC are gathered in B-LOC . " He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , " said the campaign official . " We think it 'll work really well . " Although officials decline to say just what each day 's " news " will be , the intent is to put a focus on B-PER himself and not just those attending the party 's convention . Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes . Campaign officials then hope the day 's " news " event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme . " We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , " said B-LOC I-LOC Press Secretary B-PER I-PER . B-PER said that when B-PER delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow B-MISC and a national television audience , he will " set out a road map " for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the B-LOC I-LOC for four more years . Hurricane expected to veer north of B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-24 Hurricane B-MISC grew stronger on Saturday as it swirled across the B-LOC I-LOC , but forecasters at the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said the storm would likely swing north and miss the B-LOC . " B-MISC is getting stronger and stronger , and it already has winds of 105 mph ( 185 kph ) , " said hurricane forecaster B-PER I-PER . " But the good news is that all our computer models indicate B-MISC is going to turn to the west-northwest on Sunday and miss the islands , " he added . At 11 a.m. EDT ( 1500 B-MISC ) , B-MISC was 1,130 miles east of the B-LOC I-LOC and moving west at 14 mph ( 25 kph ) . Its exact position was latitude 14.5 north , longitude 44.2 west . B-LOC hands suspected B-ORG member to B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-LOC on Saturday handed a suspected member of the B-MISC separatist group B-ORG to B-MISC authorities , B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG officials said . B-PER I-PER I-PER , who had just ended a prison sentence in B-LOC , is suspected of having taken part in several guerrilla attacks in B-LOC . B-ORG ( B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ) has killed about 800 people in its campaign for an independent B-MISC state since the 1960s . B-MISC troops to remain in B-LOC for B-MISC . B-LOC 1996-08-24 Defence Minister B-PER I-PER said that B-MISC troops would stay on in B-LOC next year as part of an international force to ensure the establishment of peace , a newspaper reported on Saturday . The current B-MISC peace force ( B-ORG ) in B-LOC is due to return home at the end of the year . But B-PER told B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in an interview that a " new and different mandate " for the troops would be agreed on for next year after the current mandate expires in December . " After the ( B-MISC ) elections ( on September 14 ) the troops will start being reduced from the beginning of October from 60,000 to about 20,000 . A completely new and different mandate will be agreed for next year , " B-PER said . " The defence ministers will begin negotiations for this at the beginning of September at a B-ORG meeting , " he told the newspaper in an interview , excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on Sunday . " But we must avoid giving the impression this peace deployment in former B-LOC is being perceived in the long run as an occupation . On the other hand we must prevent any return of war and massacres " he said . B-MISC comics hope independence-joke 's on B-PER . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-24 A group of B-MISC comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader B-PER I-PER next month when they lead the ancient B-MISC town of B-LOC in a mock split from B-LOC . B-LOC mayor B-PER I-PER said the comics , including popular actor B-PER I-PER , would declare B-LOC " capital of B-LOC " on September 15 -- the day B-PER plans a march across the north in favour of independence from B-LOC . " We will then proceed with the annexation of B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC , " B-PER told reporters on Saturday . He said the city council would be " ironically present " when the comics made their proclamation on the same day B-PER has threatened to declare the birth of B-LOC , the name he has given to northern B-LOC . B-LOC , located in B-LOC between B-LOC and B-LOC , was once the capital of B-LOC , an ancient federation of 12 B-MISC towns . " We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 15 , " B-PER said . " We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former B-LOC yet in which people are still talking about secession , " he added . B-PER has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his B-ORG I-ORG party 's good showing in last April 's general election , when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally . He has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from B-LOC 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners . B-MISC farmer says he mutilated four women . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-24 An B-MISC farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them , the B-MISC news agency B-ORG reported on Saturday . It quoted the lawyer of B-PER I-PER as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a B-LOC magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women . B-ORG said B-PER was unable to recall how he had killed the women , remembering only that he had found them " lifeless in his arms " after having sadmasochistic sex with them . B-PER , arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an B-MISC prostitute , is accused of murdering five women , three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside B-PER between July and December 1995 . Two of the corpses were identified but not the third , found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal . Lawyer B-PER I-PER I-PER told B-ORG that B-PER confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby B-LOC river . B-PER I-PER declined to comment on the alleged fifth murder , saying only that " the interrogations are not over yet " with investigators . It said investigators believed B-PER had suffocated them by putting plastic bags on their heads . B-PER was first sentenced for assault but investigators began digging in the garden of his villa after the first body was found by a passer-by . B-LOC asks how paedophile suspect eluded police . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-24 B-MISC police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout B-LOC . Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure , convicted child rapist B-PER I-PER , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long . In just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others . On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at B-LOC and one at B-LOC -- both suburbs of the southern city of B-LOC . Both houses are owned by B-PER . B-MISC media speculated that B-PER , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters . They put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor B-PER I-PER on B-MISC television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case " if I am allowed to " . B-PER said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured B-PER . B-PER was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around B-LOC . Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as B-PER led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses . B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER , had been kidnapped in June last year . B-PER said they starved to death nine months later . He also admitted kidnapping two other girls , B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER , a year ago . The fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in B-LOC or the B-LOC I-LOC where B-PER was a frequent visitor . B-MISC police have visited B-LOC and will visit B-LOC . Five other people have been arrested including B-PER 's second wife B-PER I-PER , charged as an accomplice . The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association . B-MISC police are also holding a 74-year old B-MISC in connection with the disappearance of B-PER and B-PER , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established . At least part of the speculation in the B-MISC media of high-level protection for B-PER and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference . Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed " B-MISC " against B-PER in 1995 -- when both B-PER and B-PER and B-PER and B-PER were kidnapped . They show that the gendarmes were aware that B-PER was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was . They also show that police investigating a theft visited B-PER late last year at the house where B-PER and B-PER were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours . B-ORG Minister B-PER I-PER I-PER has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up . There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how B-PER , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses . Death toll of B-LOC bomb put at seven-newspaper . B-LOC 1996-08-24 An B-MISC newspaper on Saturday put at seven -- two women and five children -- the death toll of a bomb blast in a market west of B-LOC on Friday . B-MISC security forces said on Friday three women and two children were killed and five people wounded when a home-made bomb exploded at a market in the coastal town of B-LOC I-LOC , 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of B-LOC . The security forces also said a man carrying an explosive device also died after it went off prematurely . B-ORG paper said the blast killed seven -- a mother and her 25-year-old daughter , four young boys and a five-year-old girl . Several people were also wounded , it said . The explosion was the latest in series of bomb attacks in B-LOC 's four-year-old civil strife . The government-appointed watchdog , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , was quoted this month by local newspapers as saying about 1,400 civilians have died in bomb attacks blamed on B-MISC rebels in the past two years . An estimated 50,000 B-MISC and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting B-MISC rebels against government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical B-MISC had taken a commanding lead . B-LOC police seize cannabis among chilli sauce . B-LOC 1996-08-24 Police in B-LOC said on Saturday they had seized 7.5 tonnes of cannabis concealed in a shipment of chilli sauce on its way from B-LOC to B-LOC . Police commissioner B-PER I-PER said the cannabis was found on Friday packed in 500 boxes hidden behind chilli sauce in a container that arrived at B-LOC I-LOC a week ago . The container was on its way to B-LOC via the former B-LOC from B-LOC and was the biggest drugs haul in B-LOC , police said . No street value was given for the cannabis . B-MISC coach in fatal crash in B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-24 A B-MISC coach crashed and burst into flames on a southern B-MISC motorway early on Saturday , killing one person and injuring 15 , police said . B-MISC television said the coach , which was carrying 45 , was en route from the B-LOC I-LOC to B-LOC when the accident occurred near B-LOC , 200 km southwest of B-LOC . Most Spaniards back talks with B-MISC rebels--poll . B-LOC 1996-08-24 Most Spaniards would support government talks with the illegal B-MISC separatist group B-ORG if the rebels renounced violence permanently , a survey published in daily B-ORG I-ORG on Saturday said . While 57 percent of the population supported negotiations with B-ORG ( B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ) , 30 percent opposed it , the survey by the state-controlled B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) found . But 80 percent said B-ORG had shown little interest in achieving peace in the B-MISC country when it offered a one-week truce in July while continuing to hold prison officer B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER , kidnapped in January . The problem of terrorism had neither worsened nor improved since the conservative B-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) came to power in May , according to 56 percent of those questioned , while 22 percent said it had worsened . The survey questioned 2,496 people between July 17 and 21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus two percent . Thirty killed as floods plunge B-LOC into chaos . B-LOC 1996-08-24 At least 30 people have been killed and about 100 injured in the flood-hit B-MISC city of B-LOC , newspapers reported on Saturday . They said 461 mm ( 18 inches ) of rain had drenched the B-LOC provincial capital in 36 hours , turning streets into rivers , knocking out power , water and telephone services , disrupting air and rail traffic , and sweeping away houses and cars . Newspapers quoted witnesses as saying they had seen bodies floating in the streets . Among the dead were five members of the religious B-ORG party who drowned while trying to remove books from a basement library . They said thousands of people had been made homeless after a breach opened in the city canal , inundating residential areas . Army troops were called in to evacuate residents of low-lying areas to higher ground . Officials said the B-LOC and B-LOC rivers , which both flow through B-LOC , were in high flood and emergency services backed by troops were on full alert . B-ORG I-ORG funded to develop B-MISC software . B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 A small team of engineers from B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's B-ORG unit said Sunday they have formed a new company , dubbed B-ORG I-ORG , to build B-MISC infrastructure software . The fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG of B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC .. B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of B-ORG . The startup company 's acting chairman is B-PER I-PER , the president of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a unit of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG as well as chairman of B-ORG . B-ORG I-ORG , which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees , combines experience at B-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , and B-ORG I-ORG . " B-MISC portends dramatic changes in the way we use the B-MISC , " said B-PER I-PER , vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at B-ORG . B-MISC is a computer programming language introduced by B-ORG I-ORG in mid-1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner . Just last week , B-ORG I-ORG and the B-LOC I-LOC venture capital giant B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said they had completed financing of a $ 100 million fund managed by B-ORG I-ORG to fund startups developing B-MISC technologies . B-MISC has been licensed by nearly 50 organisations , ranging from B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG to the B-LOC government . B-PER I-PER , another former senior B-ORG engineer who is among the founding engineers at B-ORG I-ORG , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using B-MISC to make networked applications ubiquitious . One feature of the B-MISC language is that small software programmes , known as " applets " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use . In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage . B-PER I-PER , a veteran of B-ORG and a former B-ORG marketing manager , is vice president of marketing at B-ORG I-ORG , whose Web site is www.internetstartup.com . B-ORG has funded numerous B-MISC pioneers , including B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG and B-ORG . GOLF - B-PER WINS FOURTH TITLE OF YEAR IN B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 B-PER I-PER birdied two of the last three holes to win B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC by three strokes over B-PER I-PER on Sunday . It was the fourth tournament title this year for B-PER , who shot an even-par 70 , after being tied for the lead with B-PER I-PER with three holes to play . Along with B-PER at 277 for the tournament were B-PER I-PER , who had a 68 , and B-PER I-PER , with a 66 . " It was very hard to sleep last night because there was so much I could accomplish with this win , " said B-PER , who had a three-stroke lead entering the third round . " This was a win I wanted very , very much . " B-PER 's victory gave him a 10 year exemption to the B-MISC I-MISC . The $ 378,000 first place check brings B-PER back to the top of the money list with $ 1,574,799 won this year . " This is a major championship golf course , and for me to perform well on this style of course is a big step up for me in my career and my performance in future majors , " he said . B-PER three-stroke lead was cut to two when B-PER birdied the course 's only easy hole , the par five second hole , while B-PER three-putted for par from 25 feet . On the back nine B-PER began driving erratically , and poor tee shots resulted in bogeys on the , eighth , 12th and 13th holes , bringing B-PER back to four under par , tied with B-PER , who had parred 14 straight holes after the birdie on no.2 . B-PER then set up a tap in birdie on the 16th , sending a wedge shot to 18 inches . He had another birdie on the 17th , where he his a 6-iron to six feet . B-PER bogeyed the 17th , missing a five foot par putt , and dropped from solo second place to a three way tie for second . It was the second successive year in which B-PER has finished runner up in this tournament . He lost to B-PER I-PER in sudden death last year . The defending champion was in contention , two behind B-PER for much of the day , until he bogeyed the 13th and 14th holes . GOLF - SCORES AT THE B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC .

B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 Teenager B-PER I-PER , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday . B-PER , 18 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake B-MISC B-ORG rider B-PER I-PER , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the 25 laps left . B-ORG 's B-PER was pursued past B-PER by the B-ORG duo of B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER with B-PER briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap . But B-PER found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with B-PER second and B-PER third . B-PER had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph . B-PER , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind B-PER with championship leader B-PER I-PER of B-LOC I-LOC 11 seconds behind the winner . In the second race , B-PER again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner B-PER I-PER . B-PER , the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion B-PER , had a race-long duel with B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC I-LOC on a B-ORG before taking the chequered flag . B-PER led for the early laps before he was passed first by B-PER , who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph , and then by B-PER . With B-PER out of the race , B-PER regained second place but he could not overtake B-PER . B-PER again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of B-PER with B-PER in 10th place . But the strong showing by the B-MISC riders did not alter the championship table with B-PER still leading on 280 points , followed by B-PER with 269 and B-PER with 254 .

B-ORG are currently in fourth position behind B-ORG , B-ORG and B-ORG . B-ORG captain B-PER I-PER completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table , reaching a career best 111 not out against B-ORG .

CRICKET - RUN-OUT GIVES B-PER AND B-LOC SLIM SATISFACTION . B-LOC 1996-08-25 B-PER I-PER did his best to forget his controversial omission from the B-LOC one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent B-LOC reasserting their dominance in the final test at B-LOC I-LOC . A super piece of fielding by B-PER , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for B-LOC as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 . The solitary wicket to fall was B-PER I-PER , run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where B-PER was lurking with a point to prove . There seemed scant danger until the B-ORG player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate B-PER I-PER who whipped off the bails . B-PER , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER batted through the rest of the session with few alarms . B-PER rattled along to 30 not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 24 at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role . Rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch , forcing the ground-staff into action yet again . The weather delayed the resumption for over an hour , the umpires finally announcing play would start again at 1445 local time ( 1345 B-MISC ) .

B-LOC 1996-08-25 B-MISC champions B-ORG kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against B-ORG and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time .

B-PER gave B-ORG the lead in the 11th minute .

The 83rd minute shot , curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed B-PER by adoring B-ORG fans , was just reward for B-ORG who looked a far more impressive team . B-ORG 's player of the year B-PER I-PER missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while B-MISC team mate B-PER I-PER did not play due to injury . New B-MISC signing B-PER I-PER came on late in the second half as a B-ORG substitute but made little impact . The league season starts on September 8 . SOCCER - B-ORG BEAT B-ORG IN B-MISC I-MISC .

B-PER told B-MISC news agency B-ORG that B-PER , 35 , would no longer be available for selection for the national squad . The B-ORG defender , who led the B-LOC into the quarter-finals at June 's B-MISC championship finals in B-LOC , had decided to devote his attention to playing for his B-LOC club , B-PER said . B-PER , who played in the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC and the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , was capped 42 times for the B-LOC . CRICKET - B-LOC BANS B-PER FOR 50 DAYS . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-25 B-MISC opener B-PER I-PER I-PER was on Sunday given a 50-day ban from international cricket for quitting this year 's tour of B-LOC , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said . The right-handed batsman will have to forfeit half the money he was due to earn from the tour , the news agency said after a disciplinary committee set up by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG met at B-LOC , near the northern city of B-LOC . B-PER abandoned the B-MISC team after the third one-day international against B-LOC at B-LOC I-LOC in B-LOC on May 26 , before B-LOC began a three-test series , citing serious differences with captain B-PER I-PER . B-PER was sacked after the tour and replaced by B-PER I-PER . B-PER was not considered for the four-nation B-MISC I-MISC beginning in B-LOC I-LOC this month and the B-MISC I-MISC against B-LOC scheduled to be played in B-LOC next month . B-PER , whose ban ends on October 14 , will be free to play domestic cricket . He will not be considered for a test match against B-LOC starting on October 10 in B-LOC I-LOC , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said . B-MISC I-MISC - B-MISC rugby league standings .

B-LOC , Aug 25 - Captain B-PER I-PER and his B-ORG I-ORG revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday 's momentous rugby victory over B-LOC I-LOC , B-ORG reported . Most of the test 15 who beat the B-ORG 33-26 to secure B-LOC I-LOC 's first-ever rugby series in B-LOC I-LOC stood in the middle of the empty 50,000-seat B-LOC I-LOC . Magnificent , ' ' said B-PER , B-LOC I-LOC 's most capped player and the world 's most capped forward . The players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued . B-PER I-PER , the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against B-LOC during last year 's B-MISC I-MISC , added a second to his name yesterday . I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick . The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball . When ( halfback ) B-PER I-PER got the ball he was going to go on the openside where B-PER I-PER was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way . I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there . It cost me a few bucks at the bar . ' ' The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , B-PER said . It was just like the B-MISC I-MISC , the ball came and the chance was there . ' ' Centre B-PER I-PER said he had never felt so exhausted during a match . We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said . I was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice . There was just so much riding on it . It 's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . ' ' Two-try winger B-PER I-PER said he was so tired that he kept asking B-PER where he should be while defending . He told me I 'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' B-PER recalled . About 4000 B-MISC I-MISC supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the B-MISC I-MISC capital . Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel . B-ORG I-ORG coach B-PER I-PER said Prime Minister B-PER I-PER rang him today to offer his congratulations . He thanked us on behalf of the country , which is really nice for the team , and I understand we had tremendous support at home . ' ' B-MISC I-MISC - B-ORG results and standings .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-25 B-LOC I-LOC 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands . Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid . Most , including former president B-PER I-PER I-PER and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Deputy President B-PER I-PER , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers . But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which B-PER is investigating . Human rights lawyer B-PER I-PER said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee . " I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . " That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . " The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds . But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader B-PER I-PER , have yet to testify . B-PER 's deputy chairman , B-PER I-PER , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week . He added that former hardline apartheid president B-PER I-PER could be among those called . But B-PER , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims . " A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee . At the moment this is not the case . " He cited B-PER , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks . His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that . B-PER said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission . Last week 's submissions to the commission by the B-ORG , B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG and the right-wing B-ORG I-ORG of General B-PER I-PER left many B-MISC I-MISC unsatisfied . B-PER said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared : " This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all . What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . " Political scientist B-PER I-PER said he doubted that the B-ORG I-ORG , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission . " Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation . One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said . Professor B-PER I-PER of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG demurred , saying : " In the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white B-MISC I-MISC express about the commission , I think there 's a moral uneasiness , and I think that 's healthy . Responsibility is percolating downwards . " B-MISC refugees seek to vote in B-MISC town . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 Thousands of B-MISC refugees denounced B-LOC 's elections as a farce on Sunday because B-MISC incomers would be able to vote in their old home town , cementing partition of the country . They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to B-MISC B-LOC , one of several towns where B-ORG troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived . The refugees , rallying in B-LOC on government territory two km from B-LOC in northeast B-LOC , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the B-ORG I-ORG and the B-ORG I-ORG . " We demand to vote in B-LOC , " other banners said . B-LOC 's B-MISC central government and many displaced B-MISC are angered by a key provision of the B-MISC September 14 elections allowing people to vote in post-war " new places of residence . " As a result , separatist B-MISC authorities have packed former B-MISC majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other B-MISC to vote there . Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate B-LOC as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure . " Only our physical presence in B-LOC will mean that the B-LOC peace treaty has truly been implemented , " B-PER I-PER I-PER , B-LOC 's B-MISC imam-in-exile , told the refugees . " The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , " said B-PER I-PER , head of B-LOC municipality-in-exile . " Eleven thousand B-MISC who came from elsewhere to B-LOC will vote there . How can we then expect the reintegration of B-LOC ? But no one will stop us from returning to our homes . " B-PER I-PER , a government refugee official , said : " We want to vote where we were thrown out from . This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . " B-MISC Vice President B-PER I-PER , a B-MISC , told the refugees : " We have a message for the B-MISC who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . " To loud applause , he added : " We will enter B-LOC , untie the B-LOC knot and ensure free movement for all . We have to enter B-LOC to free the B-MISC from their own ( separatist ) politics . " The B-LOC peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines . But local police , controlled by nationalist parties in B-MISC , B-MISC and B-MISC sectors of B-LOC , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders . The majority of refugees from B-LOC 's 1992-95 war are B-MISC from the B-MISC north and east . B-MISC peace troops beefed up their presence in the B-LOC area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC into B-LOC . But the crowd dispersed without incident . B-MISC and B-MISC have scuffled several times along the line in the past when B-MISC refugees tried to surge into the town . Eight killed in B-LOC casino blaze . B-LOC 1996-08-25 Eight people died on Sunday in a blaze at a B-LOC casino which the fire service said might have been started deliberately , B-ORG news agency said . The number of casinos has soared in B-LOC since the collapse of communism . The mayor has said he wants to cut their number to five as part of a war against organised crime . President B-PER I-PER signed a decree on fighting crime in July and handed wide-ranging powers to security chief B-PER I-PER , currently engaged in making peace in breakaway B-LOC . B-MISC troops start pullout , but not in B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 B-MISC troops began to pull out from southern B-LOC on Sunday under a ceasefire agreement between B-MISC security chief B-PER I-PER and rebel leaders . But in the capital B-LOC , the commander of B-MISC Interior Ministry forces in B-LOC , General B-PER I-PER , told B-ORG news agency he was delaying a pullout of troops there after a group of B-MISC disarmed an armoured column . B-ORG cameraman B-PER I-PER said a column of around 40 vehicles , including tanks , armoured personnel carriers , artillery cannons and lorries , escorted by B-MISC rebels , pulled out of the village of B-LOC towards the border , around 50 km ( 31 miles ) to the north . In B-LOC , B-PER told B-ORG he was suspending the pullout of troops from the capital until weapons seized by the B-MISC were returned . B-MISC rebel spokesman B-PER I-PER confirmed the weapons had been seized but that it was a maverick group of B-MISC . He said later that the rebels had handed them over . The pullout of the B-MISC troops is a key element of the peace plan brokered by B-PER , which aims to end the 20-month B-LOC conflict . Leftist B-MISC armed group says troops in capital . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-25 The leftist B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout B-LOC , including the capital , and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state . Commanders " B-PER " and " B-PER " , guarded by a dozen B-ORG gunmen , said in an interview with B-ORG I-ORG outside B-LOC I-LOC that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government . " They ( government officials ) want to present us before public opinion as a local problem , as just being from B-LOC and as irrational radicals , " Commander B-PER told B-ORG I-ORG . They said the B-ORG , whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of B-LOC on June 28 , had a 23,000-strong membership , but this could not be confirmed independently . B-ORG I-ORG also reported on Sunday that the B-ORG I-ORG has discovered a 37-page , B-ORG manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies . It quoted the manual as saying : " The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the B-ORG basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie . " It was the second time armed " commanders " of the B-ORG have granted interviews outside B-LOC state , an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities . Unlike the better known and unrelated B-ORG rebels in southeastern B-LOC state , the B-ORG has never taken on the army in direct combat , according to official reports . There have only been a few skirmishes in B-LOC in which a handful of police , soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured . Ten people gunned down in northwest B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 Unidentified gunmen dragged 10 men out ot their homes in a rural area of B-LOC 's northwest province of B-LOC and shot them to death , authorities said on Sunday . Police said the killings occurred on Saturday morning in the municipality of B-LOC but news of the massacre only reached the provincial capital of B-LOC early on Sunday . B-LOC is only 20 miles ( 30 km ) west of B-LOC , but there are no roads linking it directly to the city . Police initially said leftist B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) rebels were prime suspects in the killings . But gunmen of the left and right have killed with impunity across B-LOC for years , and there were unconfirmed reports that the latest bloodshed was the work of a right-wing paramilitary group . Port of B-LOC year profit climbs . B-LOC 1996-08-26 Year to June 30 . ( million B-MISC unless stated ) Net profit 9.050 vs 6.03 Two B-MISC border police wounded by B-LOC gunmen . B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 Two B-MISC border policemen were seriously wounded on Sunday when members of a B-MISC rebel splinter faction ambushed their patrol in northwest B-LOC , security officers said . The two were wounded in the early hours of Sunday when some 30 members of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) ambushed their patrol on the B-MISC side of the border with B-LOC , to the north of the town of B-LOC I-LOC . The B-MISC army commander in the area , Col B-PER I-PER , told reporters the B-ORG , which is allied with the B-LOC military government and based in southeast B-LOC , had recently stepped up cross-border infiltration . B-PER said the motive for their intrusions was not clear but he had ordered reinforcements to beef up security along the porous frontier . The B-ORG was formed in late 1994 by hundreds of guerrillas who split from the B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) and allied themselves with B-MISC government army , their former enemies . B-ORG members have since launched intermittent cross-border attacks on B-MISC refugee camps in B-LOC , where the majority of inhabitants are B-ORG supporters , and on B-MISC villages and police posts near the border . B-LOC has complained to B-LOC about the raids but B-MISC military authorities say they have no contol over the faction . B-MISC army commanders reject the explanation , saying they have evidence the B-MISC army supplies and directs the renegade ethnic minority splinter faction . B-LOC B-MISC catches fire while landing in B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-25 A B-LOC fighter plane blew a tyre and caught fire while landing on Sunday at B-LOC 's B-LOC I-LOC airport , an airport spokesman said . " A B-LOC B-MISC military plane while landing at B-LOC I-LOC airport blew a wheel and a fire broke out , " said spokesman B-PER I-PER , adding that the two pilots on board were not injured . " Airport officials declared an emergency situation at the highest level and the fire brigade put out the flames while the plane was landing , " he said . B-LOC hopes jars will reveal secrets of mummies . B-LOC 1996-08-25 Archaeologists in B-LOC have found pots used by ancient B-MISC in burial rites that they say may reveal the secrets of mummification . B-PER I-PER , director of the B-MISC Museum , told B-ORG television a B-LOC team found the pots , some of which contain human intestines , in a tomb built into the rocks while digging in B-LOC , a village 40 km ( 25 miles ) south of B-LOC . B-LOC is the site of B-LOC 's second largest pyramid , built for the pharaoh B-PER more than 4,500 years ago . B-PER said the team -- from B-LOC I-LOC 's B-LOC I-LOC -- found four B-MISC jars and two unguent jars in the tomb , which belongs to an unidentifed person who lived during the B-MISC I-MISC ( 1991-1786 B-MISC ) in the B-LOC I-LOC . " This finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet , " B-PER said . " We hope that the analysis of such substances and liquids will reveal some secrets of the mummification process and materials used in this process , " he added . B-LOC I-LOC executes B-MISC man . B-LOC 1996-08-25 B-LOC I-LOC executed on Sunday a B-MISC man accused of belonging to an armed gang of robbers , B-MISC television reported . It quoted an B-ORG I-ORG statement as saying B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER was executed in B-LOC . He was the 26th person executed this year in the kingdom .

B-PER and B-PER met at the president 's official B-LOC residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks , the prime minister 's spokesman said . Earlier , the director of the president 's office denied a report in B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG newspaper that B-PER had already invited B-PER to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the B-MISC peace process . But the official , B-PER I-PER , said it was only fitting that B-PER and B-PER should talk after the B-MISC leader sent the B-MISC president a letter which B-ORG I-ORG reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces . The newspaper said B-PER , who is cool to meeting B-PER himself , opposed talks between B-PER and the B-MISC president . After B-MISC suicide bombers killed 59 people in B-LOC in February and March , B-PER called for peace efforts with the B-ORG to be suspended . B-PER said his current position was that the peace process must continue . PRESS DIGEST - B-LOC - Aug 25 . B-LOC 1996-08-25 These are some of the leading stories in B-MISC newspapers on Sunday .

B-MISC president invites B-PER to home - paper . B-LOC 1996-08-25 B-MISC President B-PER I-PER has invited B-PER I-PER to meet him at his private home , B-LOC 's biggest newspaper said on Sunday . The B-ORG I-ORG daily reported that Prime Minister B-PER I-PER , who has said he has no desire to hold talks with the B-MISC president , opposes the meeting due to be held this coming week . The newspaper said B-PER scheduled the meeting at his private residence in the central B-MISC village of B-LOC after B-PER sent him an emotional appeal " to save the peace process " . B-PER met B-PER last Tuesday and voiced his opposition , B-ORG said . " I am prepared to postpone the meeting under one condition -- that you give me a commitment right now to meet B-PER yourself within 10 days , " the paper quoted B-PER as telling B-PER . It said B-PER had yet to give B-PER an answer . The office of B-MISC president is largely ceremonial . But B-PER , a former defence minister and an architect of B-LOC 's peace treaty with B-LOC , has spoken out frequently on the peace process with the B-MISC -- at times urging the former B-ORG government to slow it down . Corporate B-LOC taking new view on compensation . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-23 Corporate B-LOC is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study . What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely . But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less . The survey , conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm B-ORG I-ORG , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task . Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said B-PER I-PER , a B-ORG I-ORG principal . In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on " knowledge , skill and abilities , " she said . In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals . " The good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , " said B-PER . " The bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . " Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result . Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees . This coming shift , B-PER said , " is not just isolated or a fad . It 's an inexorable change . " After B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , corporations adopted a " military model " creating hierarchical organisations where " the concept of defined tasks worked great , " she said . But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex . " Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , " B-PER said . Now organisations must change to stay competitive . B-PER says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises . If your team does well , you 'll do well . If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise . Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ? " That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , " said B-PER . " It 's not a question we ask any more . The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? ' " To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education . Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , B-PER said . For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent . Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success . " They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , " B-PER said . " The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership . It will improve a company 's bottom line . " B-MISC police arrest detective in B-PER affair . B-PER I-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 Investigators arrested a senior police detective on Sunday in connection with their inquiries into B-LOC 's child sex scandal , Public Prosecutor B-PER I-PER said . " B-PER I-PER was arrested and will be charged with truck theft , insurance fraud and document forgery , " B-PER told a news conference . He said there had been searches at three sites on Sunday , including one at the B-LOC judicial police headquarters where B-PER worked . B-PER , 45 , is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft . B-MISC media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times . He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year . B-PER said two other people had also been arrested . One was B-PER I-PER , the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored . The other was insurer B-PER I-PER . B-PER said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested . He said the connection was through B-PER I-PER , an accomplice of convicted child rapist B-PER I-PER -- the central figure in the paedophile scandal that has sent shockwaves across B-LOC . B-PER was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER in a house belonging to B-PER , who said they starved to death earlier this year , nine months after being abducted in June 1995 . Two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting for at least two more who B-PER has admitted kidnapping a year ago . " B-PER has admitted killing B-PER after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft , " B-PER said . Another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained , B-PER added . B-PER I-PER , public prosecutor in the eastern city of B-LOC where B-PER and B-PER lived , said this was a major case involving some 50 investigators -- including two from the B-LOC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . B-MISC 1997 budget due around September 10 - B-PER . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 Prime Minister B-PER I-PER said on Sunday the draft 1997 budget and plans for funding the social security system would be pubished around September 10 . " The texts are practically ready , " he told reporters after a weekend of talks with President B-PER I-PER in a B-LOC fortress . The budget had been widely expected a week or so later . -- B-LOC newsroom +331 4221 5452 19 die as bus falls in river in B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 A bus fell from a mountain road into a river in B-MISC B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC on Sunday , killing at least 19 people and injuring 11 , police said . They said dead included five refugees from the B-MISC part of B-LOC , where B-MISC militants have waged a separatist revolt since early 1990 . The police said 14 of the 45 passengers on the bus died instantly when the vehicle fell into B-LOC river from a narrow road leading from the state capital B-LOC to the nearby B-MISC town of B-LOC I-LOC northwest . Five people died later in hospital . B-MISC I-MISC highway opening put off , radio says . B-LOC 1996-08-25 The planned reopening of B-LOC 's main northern B-LOC highway as a result of peace talks with an opposition alliance has been put off until Wednesday , official B-ORG I-ORG said on Sunday . The embattled B-MISC government said last week that the B-LOC highway would be opened on Monday or Tuesday following talks with the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG led by B-ORG movement of powerful opposition warlord General B-PER I-PER I-PER . The radio said on Sunday the postponement of the opening had been made due to " precautions " . It did not elaborate . The B-LOC highway , B-LOC 's main route to B-LOC I-LOC , has been controlled by B-PER since he began fighting President B-PER I-PER 's government in B-LOC in January 1994 in alliance with B-ORG party leader B-PER I-PER , then prime minister but rival to the president . B-PER rejoined the government as prime minister last June under a peace pact with B-PER and has since been trying to persuade other opposition factions to follow suit . Earlier this month , B-PER denied a B-LOC government statement that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire in the north . Students burn B-PER effigy , battle police . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-25 Students backed by opposition parties battled police and burned an effigy of Prime Minister Sheikh B-PER during a strike in the north B-MISC town of B-LOC on Sunday . The strikers barricaded streets , attacked the local office of the ruling B-ORG I-ORG , fought running battles with police and set alight hundreds of copies of the popular " B-ORG " newspaper , alleging it was pro-government . Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs , witnesses said . The strike , called by the main opposition B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , to denounce the deaths of four students killed by police over the last few days , coincided with a visit to the area by B-PER . Local officials said one policeman was killed by gunshots during clashes with pro-opposition students on Thursday . B-PER told a cross section of people at the B-LOC police headquarters on Sunday that the government had already suspended three police officers and ordered a judicial probe into the violent incidents . The prime minister offered financial grants to the families of those killed , ordered the best possible medical care for the injured and urged B-LOC residents to call off the strike . Opposition legislators walked out of parliament in B-LOC on Sunday denouncing " unprecedented police barbarity " against opposition students and supporters . They renewed their call for the resignation of Home ( Interior ) Minister B-PER I-PER . Hundreds of police raided the B-LOC university on Sunday , arresting nearly 30 outsiders who had been living in student dormitories and seizing weapons , university officials said . Police stormed ten residence halls on the campus , flushed out people at gunpoint and searched their baggage . They seized revolvers , sawn-off rifles , shotguns and knives . The students were later allowed to return . The swoop followed the resignation of the university 's Vice-Chancellor Dr. B-PER I-PER on Saturday over the deteriorating law and order situation on the campus . Authorities closed down the 28,000-student university on Wednedsay following gunbattles between students and police . Police said they fought armed activists from the B-ORG , headed by former prime minister B-PER I-PER I-PER . B-PER told police the home ministry had already given a " blanket order " to arrest terrorists and possessors of illegal firearms irrespective of their political identities . Nearly 100 students have been injured in the clashes in B-LOC and B-LOC , police told reporters . 16 die as bus crashes in B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 At least 16 people were killed and several injured on Sunday when a bus fell from a mountain road into a ravine on a river bank in B-MISC B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC , police said . They said 14 out of 45 passengers on the bus died instantly when the vehicle fell from the narrow road while on its way from the state capital B-LOC to the nearby B-MISC town of B-LOC I-LOC in the northwest . Two died later in hospital . FEATURE - Fertile B-LOC faces drought of cash and rain . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-26 Four shiny new green-and-yellow B-PER I-PER combines parked at this 1,750-hectare ( 4,325-acre ) farm in the grain-growing regions south of B-LOC do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm . " They did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , " said B-PER I-PER . " B-PER help us if there is a breakdown , " he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the B-MISC government bought it earlier this year . The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame . A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat . And the farming sector , making the painful transition from B-MISC central planning to a market economy simply has no money . B-LOC 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as " rich enough to grow rubber boots " . But recently B-LOC has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of B-LOC , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under B-MISC dictator B-PER I-PER . " The wheat will not be of a good quality this year , " said B-PER I-PER , a scientist at the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , run by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " The temperature on the ground reached 62 decrees B-MISC ( 143.60 Fahrenheit ) this summer . We 've never seen anything so bad , " he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills . The harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in B-LOC I-LOC has delayed harvesting there . While B-ORG 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to B-LOC 's extreme continental climate , B-PER said the lack of cash in B-LOC 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought . Collective farms and B-LOC 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed . This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence . The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful B-MISC times , when the B-LOC imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs . " Agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , " said B-PER . He said his farm , its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) but ended up with 3.9 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year . " We did not have money for fertiliser , we 're in debt for fuel , and we 're borrowing diesel , " B-PER said . A few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes B-PER 's farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the 1,700-hectare ( 4,200-acre ) B-PER collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite B-MISC decay . Chief Accountant B-PER I-PER said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering 220 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance . The average family earns 160-200 million karbovanets a year ( $ 800 - $ 1,000 ) -- but many have not been paid in months , B-PER said . " People are working out of their own dedication . " B-PER said the farm sector has two options : " We can sit down and cry , or we can do something . " He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year . Planted in late summer and early autumn , the grain is B-LOC 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in B-LOC 's soil . Further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 25 percent of B-LOC 's arable land next year , for 50 percent in 1998 and 100 percent of the land in 1999 . " If we follow this we 'll be able to sell 10 million tonnes of grain by the year 2000 , " B-PER said . The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to B-MISC days has given up to 50 hectares ( 124 acres ) of land to some 36,000 private farmers willing to go it alone . Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : " In the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry . " Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain . And it went too fast . Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . " B-ORG swells profit despite setbacks . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-ORG I-ORG on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks . Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June 30 , chairman B-PER I-PER said : " Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . " B-ORG raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million - and won despite the group 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG posting dismal results . " Not everything has gone well . We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations . The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at B-ORG where we had the furnace failure , " B-PER said . B-ORG posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously . Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August . The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar . Nor was B-ORG the only operation to fail output targets . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG was hit hard by heavy rains . It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in B-LOC province . But B-PER said the greatest gloom in the year came from the B-ORG I-ORG 's blocking of B-ORG ' proposed merger with B-ORG I-ORG 's platinum interests . " The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger . From B-ORG 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , " B-PER said . Looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that B-ORG would boost earnings further . " B-ORG is well placed to take up the challenges of the future . The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses . I think we can look forward to further growth " . Citing the disposal of B-ORG 's stake in industrial holdings group B-ORG I-ORG for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , B-PER said B-ORG had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets . " We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets . The biggest of those was B-ORG . Overall a very substantial pruning ... leaving B-ORG clearly structured along commodity lines , " B-PER said . He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required . Referring to B-ORG 's increased 41.5 percent stake in B-ORG , B-PER said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more . " I think we would have liked to have more of B-ORG but it 's the question of adding value . When we bought the shares we bought ... at quite a bit lower than the price is now ... maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . " Finally , B-PER said a growing proportion of B-ORG 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments . -- B-LOC newsroom +27 11 482-1003 B-ORG I-ORG buying B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-26 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said Monday it will buy B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a former B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . unit , for about $ 400 million in cash , creating one of the world 's largest makers of intravenous infusion therapy products . Under the agreement , B-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG 's wholly owned subsidiary , B-ORG I-ORG , will merge to form a new company that will develop and manufacture infusion pumps that regulate the amount of intravenous fluid being administered to a patient , as well as proprietary disposable products . The combined company will have estimated revenues of $ 353 million . B-ORG I-ORG , through B-ORG , is already one of the nation 's largest developers and manufacturers of intravenous infusion pumps and proprietary disposable products . It has sales in 38 foreign countries . B-MISC I-MISC B-ORG is a major provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the health-care industry . It has manufacturing plants in B-LOC I-LOC ; B-LOC , B-LOC ; B-LOC , B-LOC ; and B-LOC , B-LOC , and distributes its prodcuts in more than 120 countries . B-ORG I-ORG sold B-ORG on Dec. 31 , 1994 to B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and other investors . B-ORG I-ORG said it expects to take an unspecified one-time charge to pay for the merger . It did not say when the charge would be taken . " The addition of B-ORG is expected to contribute to financial results in the full second quarter of 1997 , " the companies said . The merger will add to both companies ' historical leadership in infusion therapy and technology-based drug delivery devices , they said . In 1968 , B-ORG introduced the world 's first infusion therapy monitoring device . A year later B-ORG improved its system with the addition of an IV pump that regulated the flow of liquids through positive pressure . B-ORG introduced the world 's first volumetric infusion pump in 1974 . B-ORG had profits of $ 1.7 million , or 6 cents per fully diluted common share , on $ 53.9 million in revenues in the first half of 1996 . Excluding the effect of a one-time restructuring charge of $ 17.4 million , B-ORG had net income of $ 4.2 million on net sales of $ 112.8 million for the 1996 first half . B-ORG I-ORG reported profits of $ 8.4 million on sales of $ 29.2 million in the quarter ended June 30 .

B-PER repaid a huge slice of the 4.5 million pound ( $ 6.98 million ) fee B-ORG handed B-ORG I-ORG for his services with a top-draw second-half goal to hand B-ORG their third successive defeat . B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC striker signed from B-ORG in the close season , set up the goal , feeding B-PER as he galloped forward and the former B-LOC winger cut inside onto his unfavoured right foot to arc a shot into the right-hand corner of the net . The only goal of the match also brought some relief for under-fire B-ORG manager B-PER I-PER following the team 's poor start to the season . Home fans frequently booed their own side until B-PER turned the jeers to cheers . SOCCER - B-MISC PREMIER LEAGUE SUMMARY .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-26 The tiny islands of the B-LOC failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . Trailing fellow B-LOC I-LOC islanders B-LOC 1-0 from the first leg , they were held to a 1-1 draw at home on Saturday despite playing against 10 men for most of the match . The 2-1 aggregate took B-LOC into the group phase of the qualifiers for the 1998 finals , and kept up the B-LOC ' record of never having won an official match in their 10 years of B-ORG membership . The B-LOC must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when B-MISC midfielder B-PER I-PER was sent off for a crude tackle in the 19th minute . But the visitors responded to the setback immediately -- veteran striker B-PER I-PER scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead . Although B-PER I-PER 's 50th-minute equaliser gave the B-MISC renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated . B-LOC now play in group seven of the qualifiers against B-LOC , B-LOC and favourites B-LOC . B-LOC , who drew 0-0 with B-LOC in their first leg , won the second leg in B-LOC 6-0 to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the B-MISC soccer stage . They now play in group five with B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . German-based striker B-PER I-PER returned home to B-LOC to score the decisive only goal of their tie against B-LOC . B-PER , who plays for B-ORG I-ORG in the B-MISC , scored in the 53rd minute of Sunday 's match in B-LOC for a 1-0 aggregate win which takes his side into group six , where they will meet B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . B-LOC needed a penalty shoot-out in B-LOC I-LOC to overcome B-LOC after a 2-2 aggregate scoreline . Both legs ended 1-1 before B-LOC won the spot kick decider 4-2 . B-LOC 's elimination follows their humiliating 5-1 aggregate defeat by B-LOC in June 's B-MISC I-MISC qualifying preliminaries . The other preliminary round second leg match , between B-LOC and B-LOC in B-LOC , was postponed until Friday . B-LOC won the first leg 4-1 . SOCCER - B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC COLLATED RESULTS .

B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-MISC double B-MISC swimming champion B-PER I-PER was in a serious condition on Monday after being stabbed on a B-LOC street . A doctor said it was too early to say whether B-PER , the only man to retain the B-MISC 50 and 100 metres freestyle titles , would return to top-level sport . " His condition is serious , " said B-PER I-PER , deputy chief doctor of B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC in the B-MISC capital . " But he is conscious and is talking and smiling . " B-PER told B-ORG she was not an expert in sports medicine , but said it was too early to judge B-PER 's chances of returning to competitive swimming . B-PER , who won gold in the 50 and 100 metres freestyle at the recent B-MISC I-MISC , was stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in south-west B-LOC . B-PER said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney . Doctors operated on B-PER , 24 , for three hours . B-PER told B-ORG television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly . " There 's no need to worry . We 're going to be walking soon -- and swimming , " he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit . B-ORG news agency said police had detained one of the attackers . It said the row started when B-PER and a group of his friends were returning from a party . B-PER I-PER , president of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , said President B-PER I-PER had given the swimmer B-LOC 's top award for his B-MISC performance . " I am not a doctor but I think he is doing all right , " said B-PER . B-PER said the B-MISC I-MISC might ask the government to take measures to protect the country 's best athletes , some of whom have already chosen to live abroad for fear of a surge in crime in B-MISC B-LOC .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-26 Two key players left a B-MISC championship match early on Sunday because they had to catch a plane to B-LOC to play with the national team . B-ORG I-ORG midfielder B-PER and B-ORG defender B-PER were both substituted during their teams ' game , taken to B-LOC I-LOC airport and flown to B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC in a private jet chartered by the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) . At B-LOC , they joined up with the national team squad for the journey to B-LOC , where B-LOC will face B-LOC in a friendly international on Wednesday . The problem arose because the B-ORG I-ORG clash was selected as the day 's televised live match , forcing it to be put back three hours from the usual kickoff time . B-ORG suffered more from their loss as B-PER 's replacement B-PER gave away a penalty from which B-ORG I-ORG scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 win . B-ORG I-ORG lead the first stage of the championship on goal difference from surprise package B-ORG , who beat B-ORG 2-1 . B-ORG , who played in a tournament in B-LOC last week , also faced a plane marathon as they attempted to keep up with a hectic fixture list . They were due to leave B-LOC Monday night , arrive in B-LOC I-LOC on Tuesday morning , catch another plane to the southern city of B-LOC one hour later and then play away to B-ORG I-ORG in the B-MISC championship the same evening . B-ORG striker B-PER , who was overlooked by B-PER for the tour which also features a game away to the B-LOC on Sunday , scored his third goal in three games as the defending champions beat B-ORG 2-1 away . B-PER , who has been top-scorer in the competition for the last two seasons , has been struggling against injury for most of this year . SOCCER - B-MISC CHAMPIONSHIP RESULTS .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-26 A message on television monitors all around the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC reads : " Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids " -- sound advice until you check out the price of fluids . Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : " ...and bring plenty of money . " A small bottle of a garishly-coloured sports drink at the sun-drenched B-MISC I-MISC is going for $ 3.75 , while a litre of basic , life-sustaining water will set you back $ 4.00 -- for water ? " At the B-MISC water was only a dollar , and that was the B-MISC , " said one incredulous fan , noting that the B-MISC I-MISC had been notorious for price gouging . B-MISC I-MISC officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw . When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended . " That baked lasagna better be good for $ 8.50 , " said B-MISC I-MISC B-PER I-PER , a B-MISC I-MISC regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home . A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good , but B-PER I-PER chimed in , " The water is ridiculous , they want four dollars for the water , you might as well get a glass of wine . " Indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ 4.75 , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 4.50 . What 's the message here ? " Maybe they want us to be alcoholics , " B-PER joked before lifting her glass of wine . Fans will be shelling out $ 12.50 for a hamburger and a large french fries . And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty . Make that $ 16.50 . Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ 8.00 . Of course , it is served on a tuscan roll . It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from B-LOC every day that drives up the price of the sandwich . TENNIS - B-PER AND B-PER FALL , UP-AND-COMERS ADVANCE AT B-MISC . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-26 B-PER I-PER led a youthful charge and B-MISC I-MISC finalist B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the B-MISC I-MISC tennis championships . The 15-year-old B-PER , seeded 16th , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last B-MISC I-MISC on B-LOC I-LOC but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked B-PER I-PER of B-LOC . " It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court , " said a cheery B-PER , who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched B-MISC . Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at B-LOC I-LOC were the sixth-seeded B-PER of B-LOC and 12th seed B-PER of B-LOC . B-PER , who lost to B-PER I-PER in the B-MISC I-MISC final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater B-PER I-PER of B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER , ranked 17th , avenged her defeat to B-PER in the B-MISC I-MISC semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 . " I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , " said B-PER , 24 . " I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm . " She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down . She played one great game and than a few errors . The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . " B-PER , who reached the final a week ago at B-LOC I-LOC , could only mourn her luck of the draw . " I was n't happy when I saw the draw . She was the first non- seeded player , " said the 21-year-old B-MISC . " It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a B-MISC I-MISC . " I think I did n't play that bad today . It was maybe my best first round match in a B-MISC I-MISC I ever played . " Monday brought the best out in B-MISC I-MISC rookie B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , ranked 110th . The 18-year-old B-PER , last year 's B-MISC junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the B-MISC by removing B-PER 6-4 6-2 . The curtain-raising victories by B-PER and B-PER provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks . The B-MISC teenager , a twice B-MISC I-MISC junior champion and a B-MISC juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's B-MISC I-MISC . " I hope I can get into the last 16 , " said B-PER , seeded to face third seed B-PER I-PER I-PER in the fourth round . B-PER has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( 3.5 kilos ) in advance of the championships . " There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there , " she said . " Then we 'll see if B-PER will be there , too . " The fast-moving B-PER , 18 , was cool in her opening match . " I was n't scared when I heard that I was playing B-PER , " said B-PER . " I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca n't be scared . " B-PER is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros . " In terms of tennis , I think the junior players are really good now . In a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . " Two big-serving women 's players made quick work of B-MISC opponents . B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC , the 13th seed , was a 6-1 6-4 winner over B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER , while B-MISC veteran B-PER I-PER prevailed over B-PER I-PER 6-2 6-3 . B-MISC B-PER I-PER , seeded 14th , also reached the second round with a 6-2 6-1 victory over B-PER I-PER of B-LOC . TENNIS - B-PER GLAD HE STAYED AFTER B-MISC VICTORY . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-26 B-PER I-PER nearly pulled out of the B-MISC I-MISC in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former B-MISC champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier B-PER I-PER . " I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' " said B-PER , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week . " But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . " In a break from tradition , the B-MISC did not seed in strict accordance with B-ORG rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward B-LOC players . One prominent player that did not stay for the B-MISC was B-MISC I-MISC champion B-PER I-PER , who after being dropped three spots from his B-ORG ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to B-LOC . B-PER had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury . At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , B-LOC B-MISC I-MISC player B-PER I-PER expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings . " The way the B-MISC I-MISC has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this B-MISC I-MISC in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , " B-PER said . B-PER said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest . " I feel that we made it a little easy for the B-ORG . They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , " said B-PER . " I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . " But once the 27-year-old B-PER got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last B-MISC I-MISC . He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot B-PER on a sun-baked B-MISC court . Others advancing early on Monday included 11th-seeded B-MISC B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC runner-up , B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER , and two-time former B-MISC I-MISC champion B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , who will be B-PER 's next opponent . The suspicion , however , lingers in B-PER 's mind that B-MISC I-MISC officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players . " I get the feeling that everything is done here for the B-MISC players and they forget about all the other players , " said B-PER , who lost the 1994 B-MISC final to B-PER I-PER . It was B-PER who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday . The flamboyant B-MISC star was bumped up two spots from his B-ORG ranking of eight to a seeding of six . " He ( B-PER ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , " said B-PER about the unfairness of moving up B-PER , who made early exits from the B-MISC I-MISC and B-MISC . B-PER , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after B-PER withdrew . Ranked 18th in the world , B-PER might have been slipped into that spot ahead of B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER , who is 16th but had never been played in the B-MISC and had been left out of the seedings originally . But B-PER did n't want to play that game . " I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded , " B-PER said .

After appearing as a pinch-hitter in the previous two games , B-PER , who has been battling a hamstring injury , did not see any action today , ending his streak at 357 consecutive games .

PRESS DIGEST - B-LOC - AUGUST 26 . B-LOC 1996-08-26 This is the leading story in the B-MISC press on Monday . B-ORG has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy . B-ORG - At least 20 people were killed when the two trucks in which they were travelling collided at B-LOC about 160 km north of B-LOC on Saturday , the B-LOC daily B-ORG said . B-ORG I-ORG files reorganization plan . [ CORRECTED 18:00 B-MISC ] B-LOC , B-LOC . 1996-08-26 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , an operator of 42 family apparel stores in six northwestern states , said it has filed a reorganization plan in bankruptcy court in B-LOC . ( Corrects to make clear a reorganization plan has been filed ) . The reorganization plan calls for all secured claims to be paid in full . Unsecured claims , including those of company bondholders , will be satisfied by issuing new common stock and warrants . Unsecured claims are estimated at about $ 90 million . B-ORG said it plans to issue 9 million shares of new common stock . Of that amount , 4.05 million and 5.67 million shares will be allocated to the company 's trade creditors . Between 4.75 and 3.13 million shares will be allocated to bondholders and other unsecured non-trade creditors and 200,000 will be allocated to existing shareholders in exchange for all existing stock of the company . Bondholders and other unsecured non-trade creditors will receive warrants four about 2.2 million shares when the company 's market capitalization reaches $ 20 million . Bondholders , other unsecured non-trade creditors , and existing shareholders also will receive warrants entitling them to roughly 800,000 shares when the company 's market capitalization reaches $ 25 million . Management will receive options to purchase 10 percent of the company 's outstanding common stock with protection against dilution at an option exercise price of $ 1 million . Passengers rescued from blazing ferry off B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-26 More than 100 people were safely evacuated on Monday from a ferry that caught fire soon after leaving B-LOC in B-LOC 's B-LOC I-LOC , police said . Police said the 111 passengers and six crew on board the ferry B-MISC I-MISC , owned by B-LOC 's B-ORG line , were rescued by a variety of private and commercial boats after fire broke out in the engine room soon after it left port . An 88-year-old woman was taken to hospital with leg injuries , according to a spokesman for B-LOC police . The ferry , which was towed into port , had been bound for B-LOC , another in a cluster of small B-MISC islands off north-west B-LOC . B-ORG delays decision on refugee voting . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-LOC 's election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting , an B-ORG spokeswoman said on Monday . Officials from the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of B-MISC refugees . International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies . " Tomorrow ... the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only ... the other elections will be held on September 14 , " B-ORG spokeswoman B-PER I-PER told reporters in B-LOC . " I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled . I think probably if the decision ( to cancell ) were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections .. . " B-PER added that options other than postponement were also on the table , but she refused to specify what they were . The B-LOC peace agreement gave the B-ORG a mandate to organise B-MISC elections . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG is B-ORG 's top rule-making body for the poll . More than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55 countries around the world , representing about 20 per cent of B-LOC 's total electorate . They are due to begin voting on Wednesday , August 28 , just one day after the B-ORG is supposed to make its decision . Balloting inside B-LOC is scheduled for September 14 , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate B-MISC and B-MISC parliaments , a national B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and a three-man Presidency . A B-LOC daily newspaper , B-ORG I-ORG , which is close to B-LOC 's B-MISC nationalist B-ORG party , on Monday said the B-ORG would postpone the municipal-level elections until the Spring of 1997 because of the refugee registration problems . B-ORG has a representative on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " I do n't know what the source of the B-ORG I-ORG report is , but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the B-ORG , " said an B-ORG staff member in B-LOC who asked not to be named . " The word is that B-PER has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the B-ORG on Tuesday to take everyone 's temperature on the issue . " Ambassador B-PER I-PER , an B-MISC , heads the B-ORG mission in B-LOC . B-ORG and independent monitors allege that B-MISC authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war . Instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had B-MISC majorities before the 43-month B-MISC war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of " ethnic cleansing " . Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure B-MISC control over pivotal towns inside the 49 per cent of B-LOC known as the B-MISC republic , consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war . The top B-ORG refugee official in the B-LOC highlighted the voter registration problem on Monday . " Results of the registration for September elections herald a dismal future for multi-ethnicity in B-LOC , " warned B-PER I-PER , Special Envoy for the B-ORG High Commissioner for Refugees in B-LOC I-LOC . " In the run-up to elections , nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic / sectarian card , drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear . " After truce , B-PER faces tougher B-MISC problem . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-PER I-PER may finally get to discuss his B-MISC peace proposals with B-PER I-PER on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels . It could be a sobering experience for the B-LOC security chief who , just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the B-MISC crisis , had promised to wrap up the 20-month war by the weekend . Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , B-PER may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and B-LOC 's insistence that B-LOC remain part of B-LOC , will be no easy matter . A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple , B-PER managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the B-MISC army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held B-MISC capital B-LOC . He returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed . But then he apparently thought better of it . Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in B-LOC -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday . He met B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER on Monday and , according to the press service of B-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG , could meet B-PER on Tuesday . It was not clear if the start of B-PER 's holiday , announced later , would affect plans to talk . B-LOC 's as yet undisclosed proposals on B-LOC 's political future have , meanwhile , been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments . It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan . Speculation mounted last week that B-PER was operating out on a limb in B-LOC as B-PER , hardly seen since his reelection last month , kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce . But B-PER took pains at the weekend to insist B-PER was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff B-PER I-PER had been agreed by B-PER . If that were the case , it was unclear why B-PER suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in B-LOC . B-PER himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in B-LOC , who have profited from the war and want it to go on , would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him . B-PER warned that B-PER risked the same fate as a former B-MISC army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by -- so the B-MISC say -- B-MISC forces . B-PER may also have made new demands on B-PER , forcing him to check back with the B-LOC on what he could offer . A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date . B-PER said voters should decide B-LOC 's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the B-LOC I-LOC -- something B-LOC fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions , particularly in the strategic B-LOC I-LOC . B-PER may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war . B-PER on holiday from Monday - B-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-MISC President B-PER I-PER began a new summer holiday on Monday but would remain in control of affairs of state , B-ORG news agency said . " The head of state 's holiday has only just begun , " the agency quoted B-PER I-PER as saying , adding that the president was currently in a B-LOC residence near B-LOC . B-ORG said B-PER did not exclude that B-PER could spend some time in other places . He would continue working on various documents and might meet " one state offical or another " . " One must give B-PER I-PER a chance to rest and recover his health after the elections , " B-ORG quoted B-PER as saying . " ( B-PER ) controls internal and international policies , daily receives a big packet of documents from B-LOC , which demand his intervention ... Many of those documents return to the president 's administration the same day , " he said . B-PER went on a two-day trip outside B-LOC last week to check out a holiday home . B-ORG I-ORG workers ' protest enters 2nd week . B-LOC 1996-08-26 Thousands of workers of B-LOC 's B-ORG arms factory entered the second week of protests on Monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant 's production . " We are stubborn , have strength and time to persist until our demands are met , " said the factory 's trade union secretary B-PER I-PER . " We are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us . " Trade unions demanded payment of June and July wages and last year 's holiday pay , and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant . The former B-MISC national army consumed 90 percent of B-ORG 's pre-war output , but like the rest of B-LOC 's economy , the new army of B-LOC and B-LOC is crippled by lack of funds . In B-LOC where the plant is based , 9,000 to 10,000 people gathered in the central square to express their bitterness at what B-PER called government indifference . The ruling B-ORG I-ORG last week accused B-LOC 's opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers ' already difficult social position for their own interests . " Late wages , no work and ( the lack of a ) production programme are the main reasons for their protests , " a senior member of the local B-ORG I-ORG branch told B-ORG . " But there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections . " Federal B-MISC elections are due on November 3 . The party official said the union 's figure on the number of protesters was exaggerated . " There were about 1,400 to 1,600 people at the protest today -- much less then last week . " But there were more observers and passers by , " he said . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG +381 11 222 4254 B-MISC lending rate falls to 8.0 vs 9.1 pct . B-LOC 1996-08-26 The B-MISC lending rate fell to 8.0 percent on Monday from last Friday 's 9.1 percent after thin demand for kuna forced bank lenders to trim their rates further . B-ORG call money was down to 8.0 from 10.0 percent . Insurers ' five-10 and 10-15 day loans were made at a steady 8.0 percent after last week 's drop from an earlier 15 percent . Total B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG settlements shrank to 17.4 million kuna , of which dealers put new borrowing at a meagre 5.5 million . Supply stood at a high 180 million kuna . Overnight trade at the weekend left a surplus of 1.2 billion kuna on the supply side after 40 million were settled . B-LOC 's central bank again stayed out of the foreign exchange market . It calculated the kuna midrates for Tuesday 's trade stronger at 5.2420 against the dollar and slightly weaker at 3.5486 against the B-MISC mark . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG , 385-1-4557075 B-ORG I-ORG air traffic controllers to strike September 3 . B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-MISC air traffic controllers will go on strike on September 3 demanding higher pay , the chief of the B-MISC association of air traffic controllers ( B-ORG ) said on Monday . B-PER I-PER told a news conference the strike by more than half of the 1,380 traffic controllers and technicians would paralyse traffic which has increased by 10 percent since last year . More than 1,500 planes per day fly over B-LOC , in a strategic location between B-LOC and the B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC , B-PER said . The director general of the air traffic service B-PER I-PER said last Friday that a controllers ' strike would be illegal . B-PER said he could not curb the summer charter flights of national carrier B-ORG I-ORG , which carries thousands of foreign tourists to the B-MISC B-LOC I-LOC resorts . But B-PER said it would be " discrimination " against the other airlines if only B-LOC planes were guided in . " Under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights , " B-PER said . B-PER said a lock-out with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak B-MISC .

Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three B-ORG I-ORG justice nominations , he warned , " Their extremist agenda would come out of the B-ORG I-ORG , into and through the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , down through the B-ORG I-ORG . " He painted a scene of horrors he saw if B-MISC controlled the B-LOC I-LOC and the B-ORG they hold now . " Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk . B-MISC would be at risk of withering on the vine . B-MISC would be at risk of being taken away from poor children . Education would be at risk . The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition , " he said . His new style mixed an assault on B-MISC with what he sees as " productive opportunity , a vision for the future that lifts up working families , that builds B-LOC stronger , that builds B-LOC stronger . With your help we can re-elect B-PER I-PER . " B-PER 's tax cut plans were called " deja-voodoo economics .... It 's a warmed-over plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch . We got burned once and we wo n't let that happen to our nation again . " B-PER ridiculed B-PER 's defense of the tobacco industry , praised B-PER for " courage " in advancing regulations of it . To the delegates of B-LOC , a leading dairy state , B-PER had the right audience in poking fun at B-PER 's comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca n't tolerate milk . " Some people say milk is bad for you , " B-PER said as B-LOC delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow . He praised B-PER for vetoing the B-MISC B-ORG ' attempt to repeal parts of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , and criticized B-MISC for " slashing money to combat drugs in schools . " " The choice has never been starker , the stakes today have never been higher , " B-PER said . " We 're not going to let them get away with that . " Actor B-PER highlights B-MISC ' first night . B-LOC 1996-08-26 The highlights of the first day of the B-MISC convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity . Among the latter were gun control advocate B-PER I-PER and actor B-PER I-PER and the politicians included B-MISC I-MISC B-PER I-PER and Sen . B-PER I-PER . Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key Monday speakers . B-PER I-PER -- The nation 's toughest gun control law is named after B-PER I-PER 's press secretary B-PER I-PER but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage . As head of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , B-PER I-PER , 54 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President B-PER in 1981 . Her reward was the passage in 1993 of the " B-MISC I-MISC " which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers . B-PER recovered fully from his wounds but B-PER , who was close to death after being shot by B-PER I-PER I-PER . , suffered serious brain damage . B-PER was B-PER 's second wife and they have a son , B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER . Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for B-MISC congressmen and for the B-ORG I-ORG . B-PER I-PER -- B-PER was best known for playing the comic book hero B-PER in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life . B-PER , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in B-LOC , B-LOC , on May 27 , 1995 . Almost entirely paralyzed , B-PER underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine . That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position . Over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . B-PER , 43 , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man . He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in " B-PER " and three sequels . B-PER I-PER -- B-PER , B-ORG B-MISC leader , is a politician with a " B-PER I-PER " reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job . B-PER , 55 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of B-LOC I-LOC , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly B-ORG B-MISC . A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President B-PER I-PER 's battle with the B-MISC B-ORG over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the B-MISC welfare reform bill . He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut B-LOC trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing . He was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for President B-PER I-PER 's big tax cut bill . B-PER , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator . His 1988 bid for the B-MISC nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers . B-PER I-PER -- B-PER , 48 , was largely unknown outside B-LOC and his state of B-LOC I-LOC when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become B-ORG B-MISC leader after the party lost its majority to the B-MISC in 1994 . A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the B-ORG in 1987 , he presented himself as a B-LOC moderate , as a B-MISC winner in a B-MISC state able to unite B-ORG factions . Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced B-MISC leader B-PER I-PER was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering B-PER in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage . In his early B-ORG years he was seen as a " prairie populist " , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by B-MISC I-MISC defoliant spraying in the B-MISC I-MISC . B-PER was a key player in President B-PER I-PER 's failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no water-carrier for the B-LOC I-LOC . He has made clear he opposed B-PER 's signing of the B-MISC welfare reform bill . He has spent his adult life in politics , coming to B-ORG as an aide in 1972 after three years in the B-ORG I-ORG and then being elected to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG himself in 1978 . B-LOC boy , 13 , accused of murdering adoptive mother . B-LOC 1996-08-26 A 13-year-old B-LOC boy has been charged with murdering his adoptive mother over the weekend , police said on Monday . B-PER I-PER , 55 , was found dead in her home on Saturday with gunshot wounds to the head . Police , who at first thought her son had been kidnapped , found him on Sunday with a friend in his mother 's car in B-LOC and arrested him . A shotgun and a .357 handgun were found in the car . A police spokesman said the boy was being questioned . " They are talking to him now about the motive and everything else . " B-PER had adopted the boy , who was the grandson of her late husband , shortly after his birth but neighbours said they often had loud arguments . B-MISC bourse to use new recomposed index . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-26 The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said on Monday it would introduce a new recomposed B-MISC index on September 10 . A B-ORG statement said the recomposed index would be more representative , capturing market capitalisation of 82.3 percent , up from 79.9 percent previously . -- B-LOC newsroom 9221-5685192 NWE oil products mixed , holiday dulls trade . B-LOC 1996-08-26 NWE oil products were mixed on Monday but markets were becalmed because of a public holiday in the B-LOC I-LOC , traders said . An explosion at B-ORG 's B-LOC refinery , which killed four workers , had not affected output of oil products , an official said . " The plant is functioning as usual , " B-PER I-PER I-PER , director of personnel , told B-MISC state television . Gasoline prices were notionally unchanged from Friday despite sagging NYMEX numbers , with the arbitrage window to the B-LOC considered closed for the moment . Eurograde barges were offered at $ 207 fob ARA for B-LOC barrels , and at $ 206 for full ARA material . " There is no market at the moment , " one B-LOC trader said . " Maybe sentiment is a little bit weaker but prices have not changed . " Outright gas oil prices were notionally softer as the NYMEX heating oil contract headed lower , and following news that the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) had issued a tender to buy only 120,000 tonnes of high speed diesel for October . B-MISC traders had earlier expected an B-ORG tender for around 400,000 tonnes . ARA gas oil barges were quiet although one trader said he had seen offers at $ 1 a tonne over September IPE for prompt barrels , while B-LOC material was available for 0-50 cents over September . The B-ORG tender had " a bearish impact , but not a great impact , " one B-MISC player said . Fuel oil markets were also listless . Offers were around a dollar a tonne higher at $ 102 fob ARA but bids were scarce . -- B-PER I-PER , B-LOC newsroom +44 171 542 8167 B-LOC saw no frost Monday , none rest of week . B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-LOC 's B-LOC saw no frost on Monday morning and none was expected anywhere on the grainbelt until late in the B-MISC I-MISC long weekend , B-ORG I-ORG said . " Apparently , we 're home free for the rest of the week . We 're not calling for any frost until after the weekend when it starts to cool off in northwestern B-LOC after the weekend probably Monday or Tuesday , " meteorologist B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . B-LOC , B-LOC , on the B-LOC border was the cold spot of the B-LOC Monday morning at 4.0 B-MISC ( 39.2 B-MISC ) .

B-PER dismissed talk of frost Wednesday by proponents of the " full moon , frost soon " school of thought . Lows on August 28 across the B-LOC should range from 8.0 to 12.0 B-MISC with highs around 30.0 B-MISC . -- B-PER I-PER I-PER 204 947 3548 B-ORG I-ORG comments on beryllium lawsuits . B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said Monday that 10 of 24 lawsuits involving chronic beryllium disease have been dismissed since July 1 . The leading B-LOC beryllium producer said in a conference call it has traditionally been pro-active regarding the workplace disease , a lung ailment which can affects a small percent of people whose immune systems are susceptible . Of the 14 remaining suits , 10 were filed by employees of industrial B-ORG I-ORG customers and B-ORG I-ORG liability in such suits is typically covered by insurance , B-PER I-PER , vice president of corporate communications , said on the call . The company was responding to an article in Sunday 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . He said the article largely reiterated information about the suits and the disease which had previously been made public via B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG filings and annual reports . " B-ORG I-ORG has been a leader in dealing with health and safety issues ( related to chronic Beryllium disease ) for nearly 50 years , " he said . " We have a record of going beyond regulatory requirements ... and we consistently share the most current information available ... with customers and employees . " The customer employee suits were filed in 1990-95 , he said . A class action filed by a former B-ORG I-ORG employee in April 1996 was dismissed in July , he said . The company is " vigorously defending " the remaining four suits filed by former and current B-ORG I-ORG employees , he said . After a delayed opening , the stock was off 1-1/2 to 18-7/8 . -- B-ORG I-ORG 216-579-0077 B-ORG cuts refiner Q3 EPS view on margin concern .

B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG carried only local business stories on August 26 , 1996 . B-PER makes political debut on B-PER train trip . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-25 - B-PER I-PER , until now carefully shielded from the exposure of public life , made her political debut on Sunday on her father 's whistlestop train trip . B-PER , 16 , was at President B-PER I-PER 's side as he rode the rails through parts of B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC , and was introduced at every stop . She even worked ropelines , shaking hands with excited fans . B-PER I-PER I-PER saw her husband and daughter off on the trip in B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC and then went on to B-LOC to begin a rigorous B-MISC I-MISC schedule . Asked if B-PER would have a prominent role in the campaign , B-LOC I-LOC spokesman B-PER I-PER said : " She 'll do what she did today when she can . She has to go back to school . " The president 's daughter is going into her senior year of high school at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , a private school in B-LOC . B-PER said B-PER has asked to go on the train trip and attend the convention where her father will be renominated , but said her exposure did not signal the start of a new political career . B-PER " is a very poised young lady , but she 's not that much interested in politics , " the spokesman said . B-MISC closing share market report . B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-MISC shares drifted to a lower close on Monday , dragged down by weakness in the domestic bond market and turnover depressed by the B-LOC bank holiday and lack of any significant B-LOC economic data . The B-MISC index of leading shares closed 4.54 points easier at 556.19 , the day 's low . The B-MISC market had been on the defensive all day but a softer start to B-LOC I-LOC did little to boost sentiment in late trade , dealers said . " It was always going to be a tough day with participation so low . But the only thing really worrying the market was the bonds , and that dragged us lower , " one dealer said . Stocks were down across the board , with B-ORG I-ORG topping the volume list and closing down 1.90 guilders at 58.70 . The post and telecoms firm posted an 8.5 percent rise in first half earnings on Friday , just below analysts ' expectations . B-ORG I-ORG reported first half results well under forecasts on Monday and the shares suffered as a result . They were trading unchanged just before the release of figures but closed 2.40 guilders down at 80.70 after it reported net profits of 34.9 million guilders against 36.6 million last year and estimates ranging from 37.5 to 47.2 million . B-ORG also forecast post tax earnings rising 21 percent for the full year . Banking group B-ORG traded ex-dividend today and finished 0.60 guilders weaker at 52.90 as a result . But B-ORG shrugged off its ex-div tag to soar a further 4.10 guilders to 214.40 continuing its explosive rally sparked by the 51 percent jump in first half net profits last week , which set the market alight on Friday , sending the shares up 18.40 at 210.00 by the close . Engineering concern B-ORG started the day well as the shares attracted some follow-through interest to the announcement late on Friday that its B-ORG I-ORG unit had won a major order . But the rally was short-lived and B-ORG ended just 0.20 up at 51.00 guilders . -- B-ORG I-ORG +31 20 504 5000 B-PER to quit B-MISC assembly seat as film opens . B-LOC 1996-08-26 Former businessman and soccer boss B-PER I-PER said that he would give up his seat in the B-ORG I-ORG by Wednesday , the day a film by B-PER I-PER in which he stars opens in B-LOC . " I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens , " he said in a broadcast interview . " Just about , " he told B-ORG I-ORG radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to B-ORG speaker B-PER I-PER . A B-PER spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received . B-PER , 53 , was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the B-ORG following a finding by the B-ORG I-ORG that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period . B-PER , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the B-ORG soccer team he once ran , has a starring role in B-PER 's " Homme , femmes : mode d'emploi " ( Men , women : instructions for use ) . He plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as " a tender and cruel comedy " by B-PER , who is making his 35th film . " I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers , " B-PER said . " In B-LOC , you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time . That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens . " Justice Minister B-PER I-PER began last month the formal process of ejecting B-PER from the B-MISC parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the B-MISC parliament . The B-MISC procedure was expected to be completed before October 2 , when the B-ORG I-ORG is to reconvene after a summer break , but the B-MISC procedure was expected to take longer . B-PER 's lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his B-MISC seat . But such an appeal , even if the court were to accept the case , which it is not obliged to do , would not suspend enforcement of the B-MISC judgement against him . B-PER faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity , since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match . He is appealing in both cases to the B-ORG I-ORG . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG drains 3.9 bln B-MISC at tender . B-LOC 1996-08-26 The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG drained 3.9 billion francs at a securities repurchase tender held on Monday to allocate funds for injection into the money market on Tuesday . It accepted bids for 44.3 billion francs in new liquidity , 3.9 billion less than the 48.2 billion leaving the market on Tuesday when a previous pact expires . The new pact expires on September 3 . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said it allocated 13.4 billion francs to bidders offering B-ORG bills as collateral , satisfying 3.4 percent of such demand . It allotted a further 30.9 billion to bidders putting up private paper , satisfying 12.5 percent of this demand . -- B-ORG I-ORG +33 1 4221 5452 B-ORG [ RABN.CN ] SEES H2 NET GROWTH UNDER 10 PCT . B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-MISC co-operative bank B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's net profit growth might slow to less than than 10 year percent in the second half of 1996 , executive board chairman B-PER I-PER said on Monday . The unlisted bank earlier announced a 1996 interim net profit of 853 million guilders , up 21.5 percent on the 702 million guilders reported in the first half of 1995 . He said second-half profit growth would depend on customer demand for loans , which was already easing , and the performance of financial markets , which were strong in the first half and boosted securities , trading and underwriting income . " We expect reasonable growth in the second half . Maybe it will be in single-digits , " B-PER told B-ORG . He said growth in customer demand in the first half was 50 percent above normal but it was hard to maintain this pace . B-ORG 's net profit was 1.43 billion guilders in 1995 . The bank earlier warned that profit growth would slow in the second half , citing the increasing momentum in profit growth in the comparative period of 1995 and increased investment . But B-PER was unable to quantify second half investment to improve and extend domestic and offshore services . -- B-PER I-PER , B-LOC newsroom +31 20 504 5000 PRESS DIGEST - B-LOC - B-ORG I-ORG AUG 26 .

B-MISC PM proposes Sept 18 for no-confidence debate . B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER on Monday proposed September 18 as the date for parliamentary debate on an opposition no-confidence motion accusing him of incompetence . The president of parliament had earlier said September 11 could be set for the debate . The opposition motion against B-PER accuses him of being incompetent , lacking ethical leadership and alleges his administration is corrupt . His critics allege he may be attempting to delay the debate . B-PER has denied the accusations and said he is ready to clear himself in parliament . " In my opinion September 18 would be a convenient date for the government to answer questions . This has nothing to do with the accusation that I am trying to escape the debate , " B-PER told reporters after meeting coalition partners . B-PER 's 13-month-old , six-party coalition government controls 209 seats in the 391-seat lower house of parliament . Political infighting within B-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG party has raised doubts whether he can hold his supporters together and defeat the opposition motion , political analysts said . " We are still waiting to fix a date . September 18 is regarded as tentative because we still have not received the order to fix it on the agenda , " said an official at parliament 's agenda section .

The B-ORG I-ORG on Friday asked B-LOC to stop blocking arms inspectors search for concealed weapons or materials they believe were being shuttled around to avoid detection . Disarming B-LOC of weapons of mass destruction under 1991 B-MISC I-MISC ceasefire terms is a prerequisite before the lifting of crippling sanctions imposed on B-LOC in 1990 for invading B-LOC .

The demonstrators , said by police to number 6,000 , also urged the release of B-PER I-PER , B-MISC leader of the the B-ORG I-ORG guerrillas , who has been held in a B-LOC jail since April on charges of extortion . The demonstrators delivered an appeal to the B-ORG human rights centre demanding an immediate end to " state terrorism " against B-MISC and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . FOCUS - B-ORG end mixed but B-LOC recovers . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-MISC bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with B-LOC clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on B-ORG I-ORG , hit by inflation worries . The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over B-LOC 's monetary direction ahead of the important B-MISC B-ORG economic survey out on Wednesday . But it recovered at the close of trade . Stocks in B-LOC started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping 0.3 percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the B-MISC index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground . Tuesday 's patchy showing in B-LOC followed a string of records last week , culminating in Friday 's trading high of 3,911 , fuelled by a wave of B-MISC interest rate cuts . The B-LOC bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on B-LOC I-LOC , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling B-ORG I-ORG back from their early peaks . Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in August from a revised 107.0 in July , B-LOC I-LOC relinquished virtually all its morning gains . " B-ORG remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading , " said B-PER I-PER , market strategist at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . " B-LOC was the one bright spot in B-LOC . Floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised B-MISC index climbed nearly 0.4 percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . " The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , " said one trader . B-MISC shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said . Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since August 13 as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak B-LOC currency lifted the mark and squeezed B-MISC investments . The dollar , which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the B-MISC B-ORG survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday 's levels . " Besides the B-ORG , there 's nothing really until the B-LOC jobs numbers next week , " said a B-LOC bank corporate dealer . " There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . " Foreign exchange markets regard the B-ORG report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction . If it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in B-MISC interest rates will evaporate . The B-MISC discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent . The dollar was also pressured by the mark 's strength against B-MISC currencies amid renewed concerns over B-LOC 's economic and monetary union ( B-MISC ) timetable . CURRENCIES The dollar was at 1.4788 marks and 107.74 yen at the close of B-MISC trading compared with 1.4789 marks and 107.55 yen on Monday . STOCK MARKETS The B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC index of 100 leading B-MISC shares ended 1.8 points lower at 3,905.7 . In B-LOC , the B-MISC share index finished down 2.43 at 2,017.99 . The 30-share B-MISC index in B-LOC closed up 6.48 at 2,558.84 . PRECIOUS METALS Gold closed at $ 388.55 an ounce , compared with Monday 's close of $ 388.75 on international markets . Silver ended up one cent $ 5.24 . More hostages freed from hijacked B-MISC plane . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-27 Armed hijackers believed to be B-MISC released between 60 and 70 people on Tuesday from a B-ORG I-ORG plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in B-LOC after being diverted on a flight from B-LOC to B-LOC , authorities said . A spokesman for B-LOC airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a B-MISC member of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , called Mr B-PER , and that police were trying to trace him . Police spokeswoman B-PER I-PER said police had already contacted B-PER and were trying to arrange to bring him to B-LOC , 30 miles ( 48 km ) north-east of B-LOC , to talk to the hijackers . The airport spokesman said the six hijackers , who police said were armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , were believed to be B-MISC nationals . The hijackers started to release people for the B-MISC plane in batches of 10 , starting with women and children , in what police described as a " controlled release " . Police said most of the passengers were B-MISC but that there were also an unknown number of B-MISC , B-MISC , B-MISC , B-MISC and B-MISC . Later they said the number of passengers released from the plane had reached 80 . FEATURE - " Eco terrorists " target B-LOC builders . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-27 Ecological warfare has broken out across the B-MISC construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins . Described by one B-MISC company as " eco-terrorism " , it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s . Famous names like B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG , a unit of conglomerate B-ORG I-ORG , have all been targeted . Activist groups are no longer seen by B-MISC firms as a harmless , badly organised ragbag of students and hippies . " You only have to see them in action at protests , " said B-PER I-PER , spokesman at B-ORG , B-ORG 's aggregates company . " They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the B-MISC -- we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . " One road protestor under the codename B-PER I-PER told construction journal " B-ORG " earlier this year , " If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . " As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the " terror " tactics used . B-ORG 's contract to build the controversial B-LOC bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive B-PER I-PER 's home . A B-ORG spokesman told B-ORG : " We 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house . But it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . " Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation . Other larger activist groups include B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG . The groups have targeted specific projects like the B-LOC bypass and the B-LOC motorway through B-LOC I-LOC in the southern county of B-LOC . But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities . The government has slashed its road-building spending . Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological . B-PER I-PER , chief executive of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said : " I do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project . " But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago . There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . " He says the damage comes in two forms : " Tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . " B-PER said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract . " I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . " B-ORG says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself . Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the B-LOC bypass . " It was called the " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ' , " said B-ORG 's B-PER . " We had 300 B-ORG I-ORG protestors invade and occupy our site . Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day . Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . " B-PER I-PER , analyst at investement bank B-ORG , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk . " When talking to B-ORG about the B-LOC link ( through B-LOC I-LOC ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . " B-PER says others have done the same . " As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . " For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe . B-MISC I-MISC ends in high spirits . B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-LOC 's annual B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , the largest in B-LOC and second in the world only to B-LOC , ended peacefully on Monday with an estimated 800,000 revellers singing and dancing the day away in high spirits . Police said they made 30 arrests and there were two stabbings . But there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival , and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured . Around 400 police were wounded in riots in 1976 when the carnival , now in its 31st year , acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering . Shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the weekend , but for four or five years there has been no disorder and relatively little crime .

B-LOC newspaper reports central bank scandal . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC 's central bank suffered seven billion rupiah ( $ 2.9 million ) in losses resulting from fake transactions , the B-ORG I-ORG reported on Tuesday . A B-ORG I-ORG spokeswoman confirmed the newspaper report but declined to give further details . The bank 's governor B-PER I-PER was quoted as saying on Monday about 5.4 billion rupiah of the seven billion rupiah had been recovered . The newspaper said it was the central bank 's first public scandal in its 43-year history . The paper said five people had been arrested and police were looking for two more suspects . ( $ 1 = 2,341 rupiah ) GOLF - PLAYERS DIVIDED ON CART REQUEST FOR B-PER . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER are divided on whether B-PER I-PER I-PER should be allowed to return to the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC using a motorised cart to transport him around the course . The B-MISC has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in B-LOC , B-LOC from October 17 to 20 have been asked to provide him with a buggy . " If the ( B-MISC 's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it , " said B-PER , B-PER 's compatriot and B-MISC I-MISC captain . But commitee member B-PER said it could set an unhelpful precedent . " I know B-PER 's situation is very unfortunate , but I do n't think we can start giving dispensations , " he said . " You 've got to have a rule for everybody and I do n't think it 's feasible . " The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if B-PER is allowed to use one in B-LOC , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year 's B-MISC I-MISC .

B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-PER I-PER , the 43-year-old former B-LOC captain , is to continue playing county cricket for at least another season , his club B-ORG announced on Tuesday . Opener B-PER 's decision comes towards the end of a season in which he has underlined his consistency by becoming the leading scorer in B-ORG 's history , beating B-PER I-PER 's aggregate of 29,434 . B-PER , who retired from test cricket after the 1994-95 tour of B-LOC but is now an B-LOC selector , is seventh in this season 's first-class averages with 1,429 runs at 64.95 , having hit five centuries and one double century . B-ORG secretary-general manager B-PER I-PER said : " He is a remarkable batsman and still the best in this country . No-one will argue with that .

" We 've been working all year on my follow-through , and I really concentrated on that , " B-PER said . " It gave me more life in all of my pitches , so the ball moved more . " At B-LOC , B-PER I-PER homered and drove in three runs as the B-ORG I-ORG had 10 extra-base hits and B-PER I-PER won his first game in almost a year in a 9-5 rain-shortened seven-inning victory over the B-ORG I-ORG .

BASEBALL - B-ORG WIN , B-ORG LOSE . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-PER I-PER 's bases-loaded walk scored B-PER I-PER with the winning run in the bottom of the 10th as the B-ORG I-ORG regained control of the top spot in the wild-card race with a wild 12-11 victory over the B-ORG I-ORG . Trailing by a run entering the 11th , the B-ORG rallied against B-ORG reliever B-PER I-PER ( 0-2 ) with a walk and a triple by B-PER I-PER to tie the game . Then B-ORG manager B-PER I-PER decided to intentionally walk B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER to load the bases but B-PER was nowhere near the plate to B-PER . The decisive pitch nearly hit B-PER and gave the B-ORG a one-half game lead over the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in the wild-card race . In B-LOC , B-PER I-PER 's eighth-inning single snapped a tie as the B-ORG I-ORG edged the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 2-1 in the opener of a three-game series . B-ORG I-ORG starter B-PER I-PER left the game in the first inning after B-ORG shortstop B-PER I-PER lined a shot off his left elbow . The B-ORG have lost 12 of their last 19 games and their lead in the B-MISC B-MISC over B-ORG fell to five games . At B-LOC , B-PER I-PER pitched a six-hitter for his third complete game of the season and B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER hit solo home runs in the second inning as the surging B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG won their third straight 4-1 over the B-ORG I-ORG .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-26 B-PER I-PER is playing in his 10th B-MISC I-MISC and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 24-year-old B-MISC had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day . B-PER , seeded second behind defending champion B-PER I-PER , took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked B-PER I-PER of B-LOC 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 , 8-6 in the tiebreaker . " I was pretty tight the whole match , " conceded B-PER , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish . " Everyone has moments when they get tight . Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . " Joining B-PER into the second round was B-MISC runner-up B-PER I-PER , the 11th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented B-MISC B-PER I-PER 6-4 2-6 7-6 ( 7-5 ) 6-1 . B-PER 's win was not comfortable , either . The 27-year-old B-MISC hurried off the B-LOC I-LOC for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against B-PER . " Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , " said B-LOC . " Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . " B-PER and B-PER were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall . B-MISC I-MISC runner-up B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked B-MISC I-MISC B-PER I-PER in her opening match . B-PER claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to B-PER in B-LOC by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory . Last year 's B-MISC junior champion , B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 B-PER I-PER of B-LOC 6-4 6-2 . Other men 's winners included a pair of former B-MISC I-MISC tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round . B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER , the 1991 B-MISC champion , and two-time B-MISC I-MISC winner B-PER I-PER of B-LOC will face each other next after beating B-MISC B-PER I-PER 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 , and B-MISC B-PER I-PER 6-2 6-0 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , respectively . B-PER I-PER , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in B-LOC I-LOC , advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER . B-MISC bad boy B-PER I-PER caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of B-MISC B-PER I-PER due to heat exhaustion . B-PER was leading 6-7 ( 5-7 ) 6-4 6-1 3-1 . B-PER blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with B-PER , who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 B-LOC B-MISC . B-PER committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the B-MISC , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults . The most deflating double fault came when B-PER was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker . The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to B-PER after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net . First B-PER approached the umpire , then B-PER , then B-PER again before play finally resumed . " Those little seconds were like an hour to me , " said B-PER , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance . B-PER ran off the next three points to close out the match but for B-PER , the contest was a personal victory . The 26-year-old B-MISC had risen into the top 30 in 1992 . The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in B-LOC I-LOC . He died slumped against B-PER , who subsequently lost interest in tennis . " Two months ago I started talking about quitting , " said B-PER , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the B-MISC qualifying tournament last weekend . " I believe in my game again , " he said . At the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced . Eighth seed B-PER I-PER withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and 1988 B-MISC champion B-PER I-PER bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said . Women 's ninth seed B-PER I-PER I-PER pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist . SOCCER - B-MISC FIRST DIVISION SUMMARY .

B-LOC 1996-08-27 Former B-MISC champions B-ORG held B-MISC champions B-ORG to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on Tuesday . The bill looked promising but both sides , struggling to find their form early in the season , were disappointing . B-ORG , who start their B-MISC I-MISC campaign next week against B-ORG I-ORG , dominated the match but were unable to score . Unbeaten in four matches , they still trail leaders B-ORG by one point . B-ORG , who have won all their three league matches so far , host B-ORG on Wednesday night . Despite another dismal performance , especially in defence , B-ORG restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing 2-1 at home to B-ORG last Saturday . After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season , some of whom do not speak a word of B-MISC , B-ORG are not playing with any fluidity . But B-MISC international goalkeeper B-PER I-PER again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the B-ORG strikers , saving his team with a number of fine parries . B-ORG now lie seventh in the league on five points . SOCCER - B-MISC FIRST DIVISION RESULT .

B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-MISC league leaders B-ORG I-ORG said on Tuesday they would appeal against a nine-month ban imposed on B-MISC international defender B-PER I-PER for his part in a post-match brawl . B-PER , also fined 10,000 B-MISC francs ( $ 8,400 ) , traded punches with B-ORG I-ORG 's B-MISC player B-PER I-PER after a match on Saturday . When officials and coaching staff tried to intervene , B-PER launched a flying kick at B-PER , but only succeeded in kneeing B-ORG I-ORG coach B-PER I-PER in the stomach . B-PER , who appeared to have elbowed B-PER in the final minutes of the 3-0 win by B-ORG , was suspended for seven matches and fined 1,000 francs ( $ 840 ) by the B-MISC league disciplinary committee . Club president B-PER I-PER said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal . B-ORG coach B-PER I-PER described the incident as " shocking " , but said B-PER was also to blame . " B-PER physically and verbally provoked B-PER during the match . The referee could not have seen it or he would have punished him , " B-PER said . " During the scuffle , B-PER threw the first punch . Tomorrow , if someone punches me , I would not know how to react . " B-PER , who won his one B-MISC cap against B-LOC in February 1994 , cannot play in B-LOC or elsewhere until May next year . CYCLING - B-PER CLEARED OF DOPING . B-LOC 1996-08-27 Veteran B-MISC B-PER I-PER has been cleared of doping after testing positive for high levels of testosterone during the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC in June , the B-MISC cycling federation said on Tuesday . " He has been cleared . The case is closed , " a spokesman said . B-PER tested positive for the banned hormone after the fifth stage of the B-MISC , in which he finished third overall . But the spokesman said subsequent tests in B-LOC proved his body produced higher-than-average testosterone levels naturally . B-PER , who won the B-MISC I-MISC in 1990 and two successive world titles , was banned for three months in 1994 after testing positive for the stimulant caffeine .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-27 Expectations that B-ORG I-ORG , the B-MISC bourse 's first foreign listing , will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price , but analysts expect a rebound in the long term . " The first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in 1996 , " said B-PER I-PER , a London-based analyst for B-ORG I-ORG . The B-MISC packaging materials company , which floated its shares in B-LOC in July , for most of the past two weeks hovered below the 6,425 forints / Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering , which was oversubscribed . The company , which asked for a two-week delay from the usual August 15 deadline for reporting first-half results , closed on Tuesday at 5,800 forints , down 300 . " B-ORG 's first-half figures will be ... between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan , " said B-PER I-PER , a B-MISC analyst for B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Analysts blame , at least partly , B-LOC 's macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for B-ORG which , operating in B-LOC , B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC , now generates about 55 to 60 percent of its annual sales from B-LOC . B-LOC 's Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged 7.2 percentage points in the first half of 1996 . Both will have their impact on B-ORG 's figures , the analysts said . Despite the current difficulties , however , analysts were convinced that B-ORG 's outlook was strong . " The eastern B-MISC market offers good chances , " said B-PER . " Just like many other companies on the bourse , B-ORG has big growth opportunities . " " At the same time , it 's an advantage for B-ORG that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better , " B-PER added . " B-ORG is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east B-LOC that a very strong increase can be expected ( long-term ) , " B-PER said , saying that several recent moves by B-ORG boosted its position . Among them , he noted that B-ORG had acquired the outstanding stake in its B-MISC folding company B-ORG I-ORG , increasing its ownership to 100 percent , so in the second half the whole of B-ORG 's figures will be consolidated . The company also repaid some $ 21 million of debt , well above the originally planned $ 8 million to $ 9 million . In addition , its B-MISC operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned . -- B-LOC newsroom ( 36 1 ) 266 2410 DIRECT EQUITY TRADES ON THE B-MISC B-ORG - AUG 27 .

B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Tuesday some of the options trading in B-ORG last Friday may suggest insider trading . B-ORG options also trade on the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . A spokesman for the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG would neither confirm or deny whether the exchange was looking into trading . " If there is unusual activity , certainly we look at it , but that 's not to say we 're doing anything official , " he said . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG officials were not available . One trader said trading in B-ORG options had increased steadily from about mid-August , and doubted whether any of last Friday 's activity was insider trading . - Derivatives desk , 312 408-8750 / E-mail : derivatives@reuters.com B-ORG target of patent lawsuit . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-ORG I-ORG said on Tuesday B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG filed a patent infringement lawsuit against B-ORG and its B-ORG I-ORG unit . The suit was filed because of B-ORG 's manufacture of B-MISC , a sustained release morphine product , B-ORG said . B-ORG said the claims in the lawsuit are without merit and will not impact upon the launch of B-MISC in the B-LOC I-LOC . B-MISC was approved for sale in the B-LOC I-LOC last month , B-ORG said . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which will market B-MISC , was named in the lawsuit with B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , the majority shareholder of B-ORG I-ORG , the company said . B-PER left out of B-LOC B-MISC I-MISC squad . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC 's most experienced player , defender B-PER I-PER , was left out of the national squad for the first time in 11 years on Tuesday when new manager B-PER I-PER named his side to face B-LOC in a B-MISC I-MISC qualifier . The 36-year-old B-ORG I-ORG player won the last of his B-MISC record of 82 international caps against the B-LOC I-LOC in B-LOC in April . " B-PER accepted the situation . He has n't played any first-team games for B-PER this season and he 's not the type of player I would have brought on as a substitute , " B-PER said . " But he surprised me in training over the last two days because of his involvement . He 's certainly is still very much part of my plans for the future . " At 24 , 25 or 26 you could get away with it , not having played first-team games . But at 36 it would be asking too much of B-PER , " he said . Also omitted from the 20-man squad which will travel to B-LOC for Saturday 's group eight match are central defenders B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER . B-ORG I-ORG defender B-PER I-PER is unable to travel because of a knee injury picked up in Monday 's 1-0 victory over B-ORG at B-LOC I-LOC .

B-MISC rebels say missionaries should be freed . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-27 The main rebel group in south B-LOC said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six B-MISC I-MISC missionaries , including three B-MISC nuns , held for nearly two weeks . B-PER I-PER , B-LOC spokesman for the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , said it was urgently trying to contact B-ORG commander B-PER I-PER at B-LOC in the south to free the six . " The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free . This is a decision of the leadership , " B-PER said . " Commander B-PER I-PER is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision . But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , " he added . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the B-ORG with spying , spreading B-MISC and hindering recruitment into the rebel group . " These charges are the interpretation of the church , " B-PER said on Tuesday . " We have no idea why they are being held . We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . " Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , B-PER said the rebel movement was working on the problem . He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at B-LOC and were reported to be in good health . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC said on Monday that B-MISC Sisters B-PER I-PER , 73 , and B-PER I-PER , 68 , B-MISC Father B-PER I-PER , 48 , and B-MISC Father B-PER I-PER , 48 , were held in a prison in south B-LOC by the B-ORG . It said B-MISC Sister B-PER I-PER , 52 , and B-MISC Brother B-PER I-PER , 28 , were held inside the compound . The church in B-LOC said on Monday B-PER , B-PER , B-PER and B-LOC were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said the B-ORG in the B-MISC capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August 23 . But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed . It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor B-PER I-PER , apostolic administrator of the diocese of B-LOC in southern B-LOC , and an B-ORG administrator and appeared in good condition . " On August 17 the mission was surrounded ( by the B-ORG ) and sealed off . The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation . Later the mission was looted , " it added . An B-MISC foreign ministry official said the charges against them were " fairly bizarre " and a matter for concern . He said B-MISC diplomats in B-LOC were working with the B-MISC I-MISC church in southern B-LOC and with B-LOC and B-MISC diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries . The B-ORG has fought B-LOC 's government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly B-MISC and animist region from the B-MISC , B-LOC I-LOC . B-ORG postpones B-MISC municipal elections . B-LOC 1996-08-27 The B-LOC diplomat in charge of elections in B-LOC announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the B-MISC in registering voters . Ambassador B-PER I-PER , representing the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on September 14 with other B-MISC elections would be put off . " I have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 14 , " said B-PER . He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 . According to B-ORG officials , B-MISC authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under B-MISC control , but which used to have B-MISC majorities . Human rights workers say authorities in B-LOC and B-MISC I-MISC territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on B-MISC territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the B-LOC peace agreement . Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war . The response of the B-MISC I-MISC to the B-ORG 's announcement was not immediately clear . But B-MISC I-MISC leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own . The B-MISC I-MISC cabinet , in a letter to the B-ORG , said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be " a direct and flagrant violation fo the B-LOC agreement " . The B-MISC , who administer half of B-LOC in a B-MISC republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections . Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm B-LOC 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the B-LOC peace agreement had planned . New talks in B-LOC as B-PER waits for B-PER . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-MISC and rebel military commanders finally met in B-LOC on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President B-PER I-PER 's envoy B-PER I-PER . The B-MISC army commander in the region , General B-PER I-PER , arrived at the rebel-held village of B-LOC I-LOC , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the B-MISC capital B-LOC for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff B-PER I-PER . But B-PER himself , the B-LOC security chief , is still waiting back in B-LOC to meet B-PER over his plans for a lasting political settlement in B-LOC . B-ORG news agency quoted the B-LOC press service as saying B-PER , who left for a state holiday home near B-LOC on Monday , would hold no working meetings on Tuesday . B-PER interrupted talks with B-LOC 's separatists on a political deal on Sunday , saying he had to consult with B-PER . After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday , B-PER 's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday . But B-PER 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left B-LOC for a holiday near the capital . The B-MISC postponed the talks after a B-MISC band disarmed a column of B-ORG I-ORG troops on Sunday . The B-MISC said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned . The B-MISC command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken . B-ORG said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by B-PER and B-PER last Thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks . Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around 10.45 a.m. ( 0645 B-MISC ) . Also in B-LOC I-LOC on Tuesday morning , was B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC diplomat who heads the B-LOC mission of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . B-PER , who helped broker an earlier truce in May , was not taking part in the B-MISC talks . B-PER 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict . However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained . Three B-MISC servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , B-ORG news agency quoted the B-MISC military as saying on Tuesday morning . B-ORG news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint B-MISC police patrols in some districts of the capital B-LOC on Tuesday . But the separatist command told B-ORG news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by B-PER last week , would begin on Tuesday after delays for " technical reasons " . B-PER 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated B-PER was low on the list by saying B-PER would need time to study the proposals before talking to him . B-MISC news agencies also quoted the B-LOC spokesman as saying that B-PER 's representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol . B-PER , 65 , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state . Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign . Some analysts say the B-LOC leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into B-LOC in 1994 started B-LOC 's ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart . But B-PER , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in B-LOC working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from B-PER . His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and B-LOC 's insistence that B-LOC remain part of the B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC and B-LOC target B-ORG , B-ORG membership . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC and B-LOC pledged to intensify cooperation on Tuesday and reinforced their determination to join the B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG at the earliest possible date . B-MISC President B-PER I-PER and his B-MISC counterpart , B-PER I-PER , met for talks at the start of a two-day visit to B-LOC by B-PER . It was their fourth meeting this year . They said in a statement they agreed to have regular telephone contact to discuss progress in strengthening ties with the B-LOC . " We expect our cooperation will help both countries towards entering the B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG , " B-PER said . " We have similar ambitions as far as our internal development and international life is concerned , " B-PER said . B-LOC and B-LOC are hoping to be among the first group of former eastern bloc countries to join the B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG . They have already signed an association agreement with the B-ORG I-ORG and are both part of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which also comprises B-LOC , B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC 's trade with B-LOC rose to $ 142.3 million in 1995 from $ 118.8 million in 1994 . During his visit to B-LOC , B-PER is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister B-PER I-PER , representatives of B-MISC political parties and representatives of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . Nationalists want B-PER ousted for B-LOC pact . B-LOC 1996-08-27 Junior Nationalist members of B-LOC 's ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President B-PER I-PER for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring B-LOC . B-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) demand as crude electioneering . " It is a desperate move by the B-ORG , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , " said B-ORG executive president B-PER I-PER . " This treaty is both necessary and good , " B-PER said , adding that the B-ORG 's stance was threatening its position in the government . The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of B-LOC 's large ethnic B-MISC minority . It will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to B-ORG and the B-ORG I-ORG . " If they ( the B-ORG ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ... We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , " he said . The B-ORG holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications . B-ORG leader B-PER I-PER said in a statement B-PER , in power since the fall of communism in 1989 , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic B-MISC minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month . B-PER 's call came on the eve of the official launch of B-PER 's campaign for a new term at November 3 polls . His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust B-PER was unlikely to succeed , analysts said . B-PER has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both B-MISC and B-MISC nationalists oppose for different reasons . Presidential officials were not available to comment on the call for B-PER 's impeachment . B-MISC MPS see little hope of electing president . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent B-PER I-PER and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state . Neither B-PER , who oversaw B-LOC 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the B-LOC I-LOC , nor his arch-rival , former communist B-PER I-PER , have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament . B-PER garnered 49 votes and B-PER 34 in Tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of B-LOC . A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result . If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college . " The votes are a strong message to B-PER that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , " B-ORG I-ORG head B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . Under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers . His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis . But B-PER , 67 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions . His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense . His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance . This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote . Support for B-PER , 68 , remained constant at 34 votes . If the third vote fails to give either B-PER or B-PER 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 101 MPs and 273 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations . This would be the first time that the former B-MISC republic has had to call together an electoral college . In its first presidential election in 1992 B-PER won the necessary votes in in a parliamentary election against B-PER . Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges . B-LOC assembly fails to elect state president . B-LOC 1996-08-27 The B-MISC parliament failed for a third and final time to elect a new state president on Tuesday , refusing a second mandate for incumbent B-PER I-PER . Neither B-PER nor his rival B-PER I-PER could garner the 68 votes needed from the 101 members of parliament to become president . In the third vote B-PER won 52 and B-PER won 32 votes . The final decision will now be made by a larger assembly . B-PER won 49 in a second vote earlier on Tuesday and 45 in the first on Monday . B-PER won 34 votes in the first two secret ballots . B-PER I-PER , chairman of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said 96 members of parliament cast votes , with one ballot paper invalid and 11 abstentions . The election will now go before an electoral college involving MPs and local government representatives that will be convened by the parliamentary Speaker in the next day or so . It could take up to a month before a new vote but the timetable is not yet clear . This is the first time the former B-MISC republic has had to convene such a group . B-LOC charges B-MISC with child sex abuse . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-MISC authorities have arrested and charged a B-MISC man for sexually abusing two young boys , a B-LOC prosecutor said on Tuesday . " We have arrested him and charged him with these shameful acts of sex abuse of little children , " prosecutor B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . B-PER said B-PER I-PER , 34 , from B-LOC , was arrested on Sunday in a hotel in the B-MISC resort of B-LOC , 45 km ( 30 miles ) west of B-LOC . B-PER has denied the charges . He could face up to five years in jail if convicted . B-PER said B-PER , who is divorced , said he befriended the boys , both aged under 10 , because they reminded him of his own children who live with his former wife in B-LOC . The prosecutor 's office said no date had yet been set for a trial to begin as investigations had first to be completed . The B-MISC embassy in B-LOC said it had sent an embassy official to talk to B-PER who is being held in jail . The age of consent for heterosexual and homosexual sex in B-LOC is 14 . A large number of destitute children can be seen begging in the streets of impoverished B-LOC , especially in towns and resorts visited by foreigners . B-LOC assembly again fails to elect president . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC 's parliament again failed to elect a new state president on Tuesday when neither of two candidates secured a majority in second-round voting . Incumbent president B-PER I-PER won 49 votes compared to 34 won by his rival , deputy Parliamentary Speaker B-PER I-PER . But B-PER 's support was not enough for the 68 needed for election and a third secret ballot will take place later in the day ( 1300 B-MISC ) , parliamentary officials said . To win a clear mandate for the five-year presidential term , a candidate must secure 68 votes from the 101-member parliament . B-PER I-PER , Chairman of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said 96 members of parliament voted in the second round , with 12 abstentions and one ballot paper invalid . On Monday , in the first round of voting , B-PER secured 45 votes and B-PER 34 . B-PER 's popularity has suffered in recent years , with politicians criticising him for taking too much power and acting without consulting parliament . If a third round of voting fails to give either candidate 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker has to convene an electoral college of all 101 MPs and 273 local government representatives for a new vote that could take up to a month . B-MISC women visited B-PER , police say . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-PER I-PER , the chief accused in B-LOC 's sensational child murder and sex abuse case , visited B-LOC a number of times and about 10 young B-MISC women went to B-LOC at his invitation , police said on Tuesday . But they have difficulty remembering what happened there , perhaps because of drugs , and are unsure whether they were filmed for pornography , B-PER I-PER , head of the B-MISC office of B-ORG , told B-ORG . Although B-PER spoke of " girls " his deputy , B-PER I-PER , said the case involved about 10 young women in their early 20s . " The police interrogated several B-MISC girls who said that they had been invited by B-PER I-PER to visit B-LOC , " B-PER said . " The girls said they went to B-LOC voluntarily and the police suspect that they were used to act in pornographic films . " " The police suspect ( the girls ) were under the influence of drugs as some girls admitted they took unspecified pills . " " We have suspicions of a rape , but the police still have to find the victim , " B-PER added . B-PER 's last visit to B-LOC was reported to have been as recent as July . B-MISC police are also cooperating with B-LOC in the search for B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER , who went missing last August . B-PER , 39 , who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two other girls aged 14 and 12 , is one of several suspects in the B-PER and B-PER case . Last Saturday he led police to the bodies of two other girls , aged eight , who died of starvation this year after their abduction in June , 1995 . The B-MISC office of B-ORG said on Friday it would neither confirm nor deny that B-PER had been in the B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 's western neighbour and former federation partner . B-MISC police said an officer had visited B-LOC to talk with B-MISC detectives about B-PER and B-PER and other disappearances , and he planned to go also to B-LOC . WEATHER - Conditions at B-LOC airports - August 27 . B-LOC 1996-08-27 No closures of airports due to bad weather are expected in the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC on August 28 and August 29 , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Tuesday . -- B-ORG I-ORG +7095 941 8520 B-MISC serial killer strikes again . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-MISC police in the B-MISC city of B-LOC are on the trail of a serial killer who has claimed his seventh victim in just a few months , B-ORG news agency said on Tuesday . In the latest attack , the killer raped and stabbed a young woman in a lift , leaving her body on a landing . B-ORG did not say exactly when it took place . Police earlier released a suspect after women who had survived an attack failed to identify him . B-MISC army , B-MISC open new round of talks . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC 's military commander in B-LOC began new talks with separatist chief-of-staff B-PER I-PER on Tuesday , B-ORG news agency said . B-ORG said the talks were taking place in the settlement of B-LOC I-LOC , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the B-MISC capital B-LOC . The talks had been postponed while the B-MISC waited for the rebels to return arms and ammunition seized from B-MISC soldiers at the weekend . The B-MISC said on Monday they had returned all the weapons , which they said were seized by a renegade group . The talks between B-PER and B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER are aimed at putting the finishing touches to a ceasefire sealed last week in talks with B-MISC security chief B-PER I-PER . B-PER , who met B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER on Monday to discuss the progress he made on a political settlement for the breakaway region , has been seeking a meeting with President B-PER I-PER , who started a holiday near B-LOC on Monday . B-MISC bishop reminds cabinet of Commandments . B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-27 The Archbishop of B-LOC I-LOC said on Tuesday the first thing he would do if elected president of B-LOC would be to put up posters of the B-MISC I-MISC in government offices . " They asked me what would be the first thing I would do if I were president , and I said the first thing I would do would be to resign straight away , " Archbishop B-PER I-PER said at a sermon attended by several cabinet ministers . " But before going , I would have big signs put up in all government offices , those to do with justice , in all sectors , with the B-MISC I-MISC , " he added . B-LOC 's top B-MISC I-MISC cleric said the B-MISC commandment " Thou shalt not steal " would get special emphasis " because it has to be about the most common thing these days . " B-PER and other Church leaders are regular critics of the government 's free-market economic policy . B-LOC 's B-ORG names new president . B-PER I-PER 1996-08-27 B-LOC I-LOC state power firm B-ORG said it has named B-PER I-PER as new president , replacing B-PER I-PER , who will head a secretariat at the B-ORG I-ORG .

B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC I-LOC government has ruled out paying ransom money for a B-MISC couple kidnapped from their farm , while B-MISC I-MISC authorities said on Tuesday they had no leads in the case . " We have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held , " Chief of B-ORG I-ORG B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . B-PER I-PER I-PER and his wife , B-PER I-PER I-PER , both 50 , were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late Saturday or early Sunday by at least two men demanding $ 1.5 million ransom , authorities said . B-MISC I-MISC officials on Monday had given different names for the couple . B-PER I-PER , an official with the embassy for B-LOC , the B-LOC and B-LOC , said the B-MISC government had ruled out paying any money in ransom . " We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , " B-PER added . A note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car , which was used in the kidnapping , B-PER told a news conference on Monday . He said the note , believed to have been hand-written in B-MISC and signed by the victims , was addressed to B-PER I-PER , another B-MISC citizen who owns the tree plantation . " Depending on you , we will either live or die , " it said . B-PER said the car was abandoned about 40 miles ( 60 km ) north of the couple 's house but said that did not indicate the kidnappers intended to take their victims into neighbouring B-LOC . The farm is in the border region where a B-MISC tourist and a B-MISC tour guide were kidnapped last New Year 's Eve by a heavily armed band led by a former B-MISC guerrilla . The two were held for 71 days until relatives paid a ransom . Two of the suspected abductors have since been arrested . B-LOC unions harden towards B-ORG privatization . B-LOC 1996-08-27 A swell of protest is growing within B-LOC 's trade unions at the proposed year-end privatization of the state-owned holding company B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , B-ORG union leaders said Tuesday . " We oppose the way the government is proceeding with the sale , " B-PER I-PER , B-ORG trade union Secretary General and member of union-based opposition party B-ORG I-ORG , told reporters . " We do n't believe the government will make its timetable , " he added . B-ORG is the B-ORG 's steel-producing arm , slated for a December sale worth an estimated $ 1.5 billion . The B-ORG 's aluminum companies B-ORG and B-ORG are also scheduled to be sold early 1997 . Arguing that B-ORG 's privatization would result in some 13,000 layoffs , compared to the government 's estimated 1,500 , B-ORG 's union leaders told reporters they would strike and stage protests if their concerns were not addressed . " We oppose any privatization that hurts workers ' welfare and does not take into account its social impact , " they said . The opposition party B-ORG I-ORG controls all of the unionized workers at the B-ORG heavy industry complex and has systematically opposed all government legislation in congress . -- B-PER I-PER , B-LOC newsroom , 582 834405 B-MISC drunks fear " lovebite " bandit . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-27 Heavy drinkers in a B-MISC city were searching for someone who has covered them in " lovebites " while they were passed out in a drunken stupor , a local newspaper reported on Tuesday . The dreaded " chupabolos " -- " drunksucker " -- preys on men who have passed out in the streets of B-LOC , 80 miles ( 130 kms ) north of B-LOC , placing hickey-like " lovebites " on various parts of their bodies , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG reported . Enraged drunks and street people in this town known for its machismo have organised a so-far unsuccessful search for the culprit who finds victims in the dark streets surrounding a local market . The total number of victims was still unknown . The first of the victims were two vagrants who slept in an abandoned car in front of a local bank , the newspaper said . In spite of the collective fear gripping B-LOC 's drinkers , local women expressed little sympathy . " Its just desserts for all the ' bolos ' ( drunkards ) who sleep in the streets of our beautiful town , " said a woman who worked in the local market . B-LOC likely to turn B-ORG federal bank - paper . B-PER I-PER 1996-08-27 B-LOC is likely to turn B-LOC I-LOC state bank B-ORG into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , B-ORG I-ORG daily said . The newspaper said the B-ORG I-ORG special administration of B-ORG ends in December 30 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return B-ORG to B-LOC I-LOC state government . A B-ORG I-ORG spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report . B-ORG has been under central bank special temporary administration since December 1994 . The central bank management could be lifted if B-LOC I-LOC state decided to take part in the recent federal government 's plan to restructure state banks . Under the plan , the federal government would provide 100 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks . It also offers to refinance up to 50 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks . Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by B-LOC I-LOC state governor B-PER I-PER , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because B-LOC I-LOC 's debt with B-ORG has increased sharply , B-ORG I-ORG said . B-LOC I-LOC state 's debt is now estimated at 19 billion reais . B-ORG I-ORG also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank B-ORG . The newspaper said B-ORG has sent to the B-ORG I-ORG a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 90-day credit line , paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the B-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . B-ORG I-ORG also said the loan would give B-ORG time to sell assets . B-ORG , B-LOC 's fourth-largest private bank , has been facing liquidity troubles .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-26 B-PER I-PER , the former dictator who ruled B-LOC for two years , died at age 78 on Monday . B-PER died after being brought to a hospital a week ago following a fall at home that resulted in a blood clot in the brain . He was operated on earlier in the week but failed to recover from surgery . The former dictator , who ruled from 1971 to 1973 , was best known for allowing B-PER I-PER I-PER , B-LOC 's famed populist leader , to return to B-LOC after 17 years of forced exile . B-PER took over the leadership of the country after five years of dictatorship . But unlike his two predecessors , B-PER I-PER Ongania and B-PER I-PER , who ruled B-LOC with an iron hand , B-PER steered the country toward democracy . That resulted in general elections in March 1973 when the B-ORG led by B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER I-PER returned to power . B-PER was a candidate in the election but failed to defeat his old adversories and never returned to public office . He was imprisoned for four years in 1951 for taking part in a coup attempt to overthrow B-PER led by General B-PER I-PER . B-PER 's rule saw the gradual rise of left-wing activism which culminated in another period of brutal B-MISC dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 , during which the military launched its " dirty war " that resulted in 10,000 missing people . In his autobiography published in 1990 , B-PER described himself as a military man with " democratic ideas . " He was born in B-LOC I-LOC in 1918 and married B-PER I-PER with whom he had nine children . He entered the B-ORG I-ORG in 1935 . Ten missing in north B-LOC ship collision .

The appeal was made on Sunday during talks between B-MISC I-MISC deputy Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER and his B-MISC counterpart B-PER I-PER , the spokesman said . It is not known why B-LOC raised the issue .

B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER arrived in B-LOC on Tuesday for an official visit where he is due to discuss B-LOC 's aid to the former B-MISC republic . The premier , who is due to meet his B-MISC counterpart B-PER I-PER on Tuesday , will also be discussing the postponed B-MISC elections , a foreign ministry official said . A small number of B-MISC had also begun to vote in B-LOC . B-PER is also due to meet with President B-PER I-PER , Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER and B-MISC businessman , the ministry official said . He will leave on Thursday . A B-LOC diplomat in charge of elections in B-LOC announced earlier that municipal polls due on September 14 with other B-MISC elections would be put off because of irregularities by the B-MISC in registering voters . He said no new date had been set yet . " B-MISC people are watching closely the developments in B-LOC .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-27 A new B-ORG relief coordinator has arrived in B-LOC to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face B-LOC 's continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved . B-ORG and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Secretary- General B-PER I-PER had appointed B-MISC B-PER I-PER and sent him to B-LOC last week to replace B-MISC B-PER I-PER . One diplomat said B-LOC and B-ORG were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under B-LOC 's oil deal with U.N . " The B-ORG I-ORG would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors . B-LOC says it can only accept a few dozens , " said the diplomat . B-LOC holds that the B-MISC memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last June does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in B-LOC . " Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them , " said another diplomat . B-LOC 's partial oil sales pact with B-ORG , allowing crude exports worth $ 2 billion every six months , gives B-ORG the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country . The deal is a humanitarian exception to the B-ORG sanctions imposed on B-LOC for invading B-LOC in 1990 which include a ban on its oil exports . B-PER declined comment on the differences between the B-ORG and B-LOC , saying only : " There are several different things which still need to be done .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-27 An anti-abortion politician addressed the B-MISC convention on Tuesday , but praised the overwhelmingly pro-abortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views . B-MISC . B-PER I-PER of B-LOC said he and other B-MISC who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party . " But this year is different . For the first time , the B-ORG I-ORG has included in our platform a conscience clause , " he said . The clause recognizes and welcomes B-MISC with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party . " The B-ORG I-ORG is indeed the party of true inclusiveness , " B-PER said . At its convention four years ago , organizers prevented then B-LOC Gov . B-PER I-PER , a vehement opponent of abortion , from speaking . B-MISC have used their decision as an example of B-MISC intolerance ever since . B-PER told a news conference in B-LOC on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down . B-MISC leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak . " I believe the B-MISC party ought to be pro-woman , pro-child and pro-life , " B-PER said . " I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . For the second time in four years , my request fell on deaf ears , " he said . The B-ORG I-ORG , whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal , faced a similar dilemma this year when B-LOC Gov . B-PER I-PER asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down . B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC presidential nominee , tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party 's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights . B-MISC also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights . B-PER I-PER , president of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children . " I 'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth . The message from the B-ORG I-ORG is one of disdain . Their answer to choice is control and punishment . Our answer is trust , compassion and respect , " she said . B-LOC B-MISC . B-PER I-PER said : " You make your moral decisions .

Harvest was also progressing well in parts of B-LOC I-LOC , but one dealer there said new crop movement remained limited to a steady trickle . " We 're seeing some new crop coming in now but it 's slow going , " the dealer said .

Experts have speculated the deposit has potential reserves of up to 12 million ounces . More drilling results are expected soon . The B-ORG bid took observers by surprise , since B-ORG 's exploration was still in its early stages . B-ORG shareholders had the option to choose B-MISC 30 cash or 0.79 B-ORG shares plus 50 cents for each B-ORG share . Shares were to be pro-rated if more than 14.4 million were requested . -- B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 416 941-8100 B-ORG I-ORG terminates acquisition pact .

" The B-MISC demand that our B-MISC leaders undergo a compulsory examination by a team of psychiatrists to see how sound their mental capacities are , " the editorial said . " Because our leaders have started to behave with extreme hostility towards the interests of their peoples to court the goodwill of the B-MISC and the B-MISC , " he added .

B-LOC 1996-08-26 B-PER I-PER , whose B-MISC husband was severely disabled in an assassination attempt on President B-PER I-PER , took centre stage at the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC on Monday night to praise President B-PER I-PER 's gun control efforts . With her husband B-PER sitting in a wheelchair to the side of the podium , Mrs. B-PER called the handgun control bill that a B-MISC B-ORG passed and B-PER signed in 1994 a major step in controlling firearm violence in the B-LOC I-LOC . But she said more had to be done . The B-PER walked on to the stage , he on her arm and with the aid of a cane , to a rousing reception from the convention . Their teenaged son sat in a VIP box with first lady B-PER I-PER I-PER and watched as his father returned to his wheelchair . " B-PER , we must have made a wrong turn . This is n't B-LOC I-LOC ( site of the B-MISC convention ) , " Mrs. B-PER joked to her husband , who was serving as B-PER 's press secretary when he was shot . " B-PER , I told you this is the B-MISC convention , " he responded to his wife , who before the shooting had worked for two B-MISC congressmen and the B-MISC national party . " Since the B-MISC I-MISC went into effect on February 28 , 1994 ( it ) has stopped more than 100,000 convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers from buying a handgun . Today , and every day , the B-MISC I-MISC is stopping an estimated 85 felons from buying a handgun , " Mrs. B-PER said . She added , " But we need to do more . We should , as President B-PER proposed today , stop people convicted of domestic violence from buying a handgun . B-PER and I join with you tonight in saluting the great job that President B-PER has done in fighting crime and gun violence . " " He 's a hunter and a sportsman , but he understands the difference between a B-MISC rifle and an B-MISC . And he knows that you do n't go hunting with an B-MISC . Mr. President you deserve our thanks . " B-PER I-PER then gave a big thumbs to the audience . B-PER was shot in the head in 1981 by gunman B-PER I-PER , who tried to kill B-PER in a deranged bid to impress B-PER I-PER , an actress he never met but with whom he was obsessed . The B-PER bill , calling for a waiting period before someone could buy a gun so a background check could be made , was first introduced in B-ORG in 1987 but it took seven years to pass because of opposition from the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG gun lobby .

Police spokesman B-PER I-PER said the six or seven hijackers remained on board the aircraft , which arrived from B-LOC at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 B-MISC ) . He said they had made various requests to police negotiators but stepped back from earlier suggestions that the hijackers had asked to speak to a B-MISC B-MISC police named as Mr B-PER . The hijackers , who have said they want to seek asylum in B-LOC , are believed to be armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , according to police . They earlier threatened to blow up the aircraft . The B-MISC I-MISC was diverted first to B-LOC , then to B-LOC . B-ORG I-ORG in merger talks with B-ORG .

B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-27 A hijacked B-ORG I-ORG plane carrying 199 passengers and crew landed at B-LOC airport just outside B-LOC early on Tuesday morning after flying from B-LOC , eyewitnesses said . The B-MISC I-MISC B-MISC I-MISC , which was hijacked on Monday evening on its way from B-LOC to the B-MISC capital B-LOC , landed at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 B-MISC ) after a flight of more than four hours . At least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and threatened to blow the plane up in B-LOC unless it was refuelled so they could fly to B-LOC to claim political asylum . " They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves , " police spokesman B-PER I-PER told reporters at B-LOC 's B-LOC airport . Security was tight at B-LOC airport , which is about 30 miles ( 50 km ) northeast of the capital . B-LOC has been designated as the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern B-LOC because it is more remote than B-LOC and B-LOC , B-LOC 's two major airports , and handles less air traffic . Hijacked B-LOC plane expected at B-LOC 's B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-27 A hijacked B-ORG I-ORG plane with 199 passengers and crew on board was expected to land at B-LOC 's B-LOC airport later on Tuesday morning , a police spokeswoman said . " That is the plan at the moment . That is where the plane is being directed to , " B-PER I-PER of B-LOC police , the force responsible for B-LOC , said . B-LOC , B-LOC 's third-busiest airport after B-LOC and B-LOC , is located about 30 miles ( 48 km ) northeast of the capital . B-MISC officials said they would much prefer to deal with a hijacking at B-LOC because of its relatively remote location and because air traffic would be less badly disrupted there than at B-LOC or B-LOC . They said police and the emergency services were implementing a well-rehearsed contingency plan to handle the hijacking . The armed hijackers of the B-MISC I-MISC B-MISC I-MISC , which is expected to arrive about 4 a.m. ( 0300 B-MISC ) , have said they intend to surrender and seek political asylum in B-LOC . The plane was hijacked on its way from B-LOC to the B-MISC capital B-LOC on Monday evening and landed at B-LOC airport in B-LOC to refuel . The identity and number of the hijackers was not known . One of them negotiated through the pilot in B-MISC . The pilot said several hijackers appeared to be placed around the plane . Painted parrot scam lands B-MISC in jail . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-27 A conman who painted common B-MISC parrots with dye to make them look like rare birds worth thousands of dollars was jailed for fraud on Tuesday . B-PER I-PER painted six green parrots , worth about B-MISC 100 ( B-MISC 79 ) a pair , with a cinnamon hair dye and traded them as B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , valued at B-MISC 14,000 a pair . B-PER , 32 , of B-LOC , was sentenced in the B-MISC I-MISC District Court to two years in jail for fraud after trading three pairs of impostor birds for 21 parrots worth a total of B-MISC 28,000 . " Everyone was fooled , " said pet shop owner B-PER I-PER , who unknowingly traded the disguised birds . " I 'd already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication -- they said they 're nice birds , " B-PER told reporters outside court . " After I was told they were dyed , I checked them over again . It was a perfect paint job except for one feather under a wing of one bird that was only half dyed , " B-PER said . B-PER said B-PER , a bird enthusiast , would have succeeded with the fraud if he had not tried to trade a fourth pair of bogus birds after an associate had told police of the scam . If not for the informant , the painted parrots ' true colours would not have been known for six months , he said . " They moult in the summer , so five or six months down the track , I would have looked like the guilty party , " B-PER said . B-LOC motorist 's arrest brings free flight to B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-27 A B-LOC I-LOC motorist got an unexpected free flight to B-LOC on Tuesday after being caught drinking and driving . The man drew attention to himself in the B-PER I-PER town of B-LOC while trying to reverse his car out of a pothole on Saturday night . He spun the wheels so much that the tyres caught alight and smoke began pouring from under the bonnet , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG reported . Police arrested the man and charged him with drink-driving , but then iscovered he was wanted by the B-ORG I-ORG as an overstayer . The man was due to catch a flight to B-LOC in B-LOC later on Tuesday . B-LOC 's SBPUs auction results .

B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC I-LOC has told its overseas missions to step up security since its embassy in the former B-LOC received a threat over B-LOC 's crackdown on radical students , the foreign ministry said on Tuesday . A letter to the B-LOC embassy on Monday under the name of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG demanded B-LOC I-LOC release detained student leaders , a ministry spokesman said . " The letter said the party would assault the embassy , other B-MISC I-MISC facilities and B-MISC nationals unless our authorities released arrested students , " he said . Nearly 400 members of an outlawed student group were arrested after violent protests demanding reunification with communist B-LOC I-LOC were crushed by riot police at a B-LOC university this month . Authorities branded the violence , in which a police officer was killed , as an act of terror . " The ministry has ordered the embassy to take urgent security measures against possible terrorist attacks , " the official said , asking not to be named . It had called for similar precautions at other overseas missions , including those in B-LOC and B-LOC where leftist groups have staged protests over the crackdown . Nuclear pact will be a step to B-MISC . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by B-LOC last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament . " Although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , " the official B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG newspaper said in a commentary . B-LOC blocked the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) at the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC in B-LOC , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament . B-LOC I-LOC 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism . B-LOC has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations . " The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , " it said . B-LOC has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the B-LOC I-LOC that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord . The newspaper said B-LOC advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance . " Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , " it said . B-LOC held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day . B-LOC was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing . B-LOC declares food poisoning threat receding . B-LOC 1996-08-27 The government said on Tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ , while still requiring vigilance , appears to be receding in the western B-LOC city of B-LOC , where the epidemic hit the hardest . The food poisoning epidemic caused by the B-MISC colon bacillus in B-LOC appears to be " settling down " , Health Minister B-PER I-PER was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet . The B-MISC colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year . B-LOC , near the regional commercial centre of B-LOC , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly 6,500 , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease . Two children in B-LOC have died from complications associated with the bacteria . B-PER told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no new victims have been reported since August 8 , indicating that the peak has passed , at least for B-LOC . B-LOC officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved . " There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , " a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September . Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in B-LOC , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection . The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme . The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume . B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on B-LOC government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic . As of Monday , 31 children were still hospitalised in B-LOC city , of whom six were in serious condition . B-LOC aluminium shipments surge 8.9 pct in July . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-MISC shipments of aluminium mill products in July surged 8.9 percent over the same month last year to 224,609 tonnes , while production rose 6.4 percent to 222,457 tonnes , according to preliminary data released on Tuesday by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . The surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors , federation officials said . Figures released two weeks ago from B-LOC 's seven largest mills already showed that B-LOC 's can sheet output reached its highest monthly level ever in July , reflecting above-average temperatures that sparked a jump in beer consumption . A federation official added that the half-year through September 1996 also appeared likely to set a new record for can production , despite cooler temperatures in August . July inventories stood at 75,632 tonnes , down 2.6 percent from the prior month . July foil output was off 0.2 percent year-on-year at 11,525 tonnes , while foil shipments fell 0.8 percent to 11,244 tonnes . June mill output data were revised slightly downward to 210,622 tonnes from the preliminary 210,683 , while shipments were revised marginally upward to 213,989 tonnes from 213,845 . Final figures for June pegged can stock shipments at 40,144 tonnes , up 2.4 percent year-on-year . Shipments to the auto sector fell 5.5 percent to 15,286 tonnes , while the construction sector rose 2.4 percent to 79,390 tonnes . Exports dipped 3.7 percent to 18,867 tonnes . -- B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( 81-3 3432 6179 ) B-LOC thanks B-LOC for support on human rights . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC has publicly thanked B-LOC for its strong support at the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , where B-LOC has come under attack from B-MISC nations for its human rights record . B-LOC 's President B-PER I-PER offered his gratitude in a meeting on Monday with visiting B-LOC President B-PER I-PER , the official B-ORG news agency said . B-PER also acknowledged the B-MISC I-MISC nation 's support for B-LOC 's stance on B-LOC , which B-LOC views as a renegade province , while B-PER was quoted as thanking B-LOC for economic and technological aid , the agency said late on Monday . In April , B-LOC quashed a draft resolution by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG expressing concern over continuing reports of B-LOC 's violations of fundamental freedoms . After the defeat of the resolution , drafted by the B-ORG I-ORG and the B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG thanked 26 countries for backing its motion for " no action " on the document . It was the sixth year in a row that B-LOC avoided censure at the B-ORG 's main human rights forum . B-LOC has been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses , often in violation of its own legal code , in an effort to silence dissent . A B-ORG commentary earlier this year said a plot by the B-MISC to force its human rights standards and values on other countries was doomed to failure . B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG cuts prime lending rate . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , one of the island 's leading state-run banks , said it was cutting its prime lending rate by 0.05 percentage point , effective on Tuesday . The bank said in a statement it was cutting its prime lending rate to 7.35 percent from 7.40 percent . It also would cut its three-month-to-three-year time deposit rates by between 0.05 and 0.10 percentage points . The moves made B-ORG the first major bank to cut rates in response to a call on Friday from central bank governor B-PER I-PER . In the central bank 's latest bid to jumpstart B-LOC 's sluggish economy , B-PER ordered a reduction of up to a half-percentage point in banks ' reserve requirements and called on commercial banks to pass on the savings in the form of interest rate reductions . -- B-ORG I-ORG ( 5080815 ) B-MISC to strike over B-LOC demolition . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-MISC leaders in B-LOC called on Tuesday for a two-hour strike to protest what they called B-LOC 's war on B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC after police demolished a building there . B-MISC police demolished a 10 metre ( yard ) by 20 metre structure in B-LOC 's B-LOC I-LOC they said had been built with funding from the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for use as a social club . Police used a huge crane to lift a bulldozer over the B-LOC I-LOC 's walls to reach the building amidst narrow alleys , witnesses said . Bystanders at the scene said work had begun on the building in 1991 and it had yet to be completed when the B-MISC police bulldozed it . The B-ORG I-ORG was set up under the 1993 B-MISC interim peace deal . " There has been a call for a general strike between one ( 1000 B-MISC ) and three o'clock , " B-MISC lawmaker B-PER I-PER I-PER told B-ORG . " This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war . " Prime Minister B-PER I-PER 's government , which took office in June , has said it will not allow the B-ORG , set up under a 1993 interim peace deal to control parts of the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC , to operate in B-LOC . B-LOC 's previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to B-ORG I-ORG activity in the city . Tuesday 's demolition came a day after B-ORG officials said they had bowed to B-PER 's demand they close offices in B-LOC . They said two of the three offices B-LOC wanted closed had been shut . B-PER has made closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . B-LOC captured B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC in the 1967 B-LOC I-LOC war and annexed it . It says it will never cede any part of the city . B-MISC want B-LOC I-LOC as capital of a future state . The city is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under B-PER . B-ORG adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices . B-LOC 1996-08-28 The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders . The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote . The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on B-MISC to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them . The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time . Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock . In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices . " These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , " said B-ORG Chairman B-PER I-PER . The B-ORG 's goal , he added , was to create " one system where one price could be available to everybody . " The director of the B-ORG 's division of market regulation , B-PER I-PER , said B-LOC I-LOC firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules . In proposing the rules last year , the B-ORG noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests . It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market . It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to " hidden " quotes the benefit of the best available prices . Earlier this month , the B-ORG settled charges of alleged malpractices on B-MISC when the parent of the B-MISC market , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices . The B-ORG dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed . The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again . The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous " bid " and " ask " quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on B-MISC . The B-ORG 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for B-MISC , where such orders have never been displayed . The president of the B-MISC , B-PER I-PER , was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world . B-MISC CABINET APPROVES TELEVISION DECREE . B-LOC 1996-08-28 The B-MISC cabinet on Wednesday granted a reprieve for media mogul B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG television empire with a decree extending the current legal framework for television stations until January 31 , 1997 . The decree plugs a legal void in which magistrates could have forced the former prime minister to take one of the three stations he controls off the air because of a court ruling that no single proprietor should be allowed to keep three channels . Passengers injured in train collision in B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 A passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in B-LOC on Wednesday and police said around 10 people were injured . B-MISC television reported earlier that more than 20 had been hurt in the accident at the station in B-LOC , 300 km ( 180 miles ) west of B-LOC . " One locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it , " a police spokesman in B-LOC told B-ORG by telephone . The express passenger train travelling from B-LOC , southeast of B-LOC , with around 80 people on board , hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings . The police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage . Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added . Greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred , a state railways spokesman told B-MISC news agency B-ORG . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG eyes hog market . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC 's largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 1997 with a view to expanding the company 's scope into pork production . " B-LOC is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , " B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG chief executive B-PER I-PER said in a company statement . B-ORG said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997 . The end of B-LOC 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie . Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie . B-ORG said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG has an export monopoly but some B-LOC farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs . -- B-PER I-PER I-PER 204 947 3548 ATHLETICS - B-MISC I-MISC MEETING RESULTS .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER fulfilled his prediction that he would break the world 4,000 metres world record in the world track cycling championships on Wednesday . B-PER clocked four minutes 13.353 seconds to slice more than six seconds from the previous world mark of 4:19.699 set by B-MISC champion B-PER I-PER of B-LOC in B-LOC in July . B-PER qualified in second place , also beating his old record in 4:17.696 . " I was very nervous before the start but then I was amazed by the speed of my ride , " B-PER said . " I do n't know if I can go any faster . Who knows what will happen in the later stages ? " B-PER , 28 , did not contest the B-MISC pursuit because of its proximity to the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC in which he led the B-MISC B-ORG team . However , he took a bronze medal in the B-MISC road time-trial and then returned home to prepare for the world track series in the B-LOC indoor velodrome . He adopted the " superman " riding position with arms at full stretch perfected by fellow B-MISC B-PER I-PER , the 1995 world champion , and taken up in B-LOC by B-PER . B-PER was forced to pull out of his title defence because of a viral infection . Qualifiers for Wednesday evening 's quarter-finals : 1. B-PER I-PER ( B-LOC ) 4:13.353 2.

To go another five weeks without that chance would have been foolish , " he added . B-PER , who has already lost the services of midfielder B-PER I-PER and defender B-PER I-PER , delayed naming any replacements .

TENNIS - SERIOUS B-PER IS HAVING FUN AGAIN . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 Outspoken B-PER I-PER exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again . " I think I 'm much more focused on what I have to do , and that 's playing tennis , " B-PER said after routing B-MISC B-PER I-PER 6-2 6-0 6-1 in the opening round of the B-MISC I-MISC . It was B-PER 's sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the B-MISC I-MISC . " I realised this year , that without putting 99.9 percent of your mind into tennis , I do n't think you can successful , " said the 22-year-old B-PER . " The whole day I 'm thinking abnout tennis . I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all . " For B-PER that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge , an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand . " I know what I 'm here for , " said B-PER , who lost in the second round of the B-MISC the last two years after reaching the quarters in 1993 , the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic . " I 'm not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court . I 'm here to play tennis and to win . I have much less fun off the court . I have much more fun on the court , " he said . Just three years ago B-PER was one of the world 's best , with a ranking of six after reaching the B-MISC I-MISC semifinal and winning three tournaments . But B-PER 's ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury . The B-MISC finally hit a low of 44th two months ago . " It 's somewhere where I would n't like to stay very long , " B-PER said of his current ranking of 36 . " It 's a part of the penalty that I have to accept . " As part of his new businesslike approach , B-PER hired B-MISC coach B-PER I-PER at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off . " At the beginning of the year we started from zero , " said B-PER . " Winning in B-LOC I-LOC ( last week ) was like winning for the first time . " While B-PER 's 77-minute romp past B-PER was rather ordinary , the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable . In the original draw , B-PER and B-PER were slotted to play each other . When controversy forced the draw to be done over -- against odds of 151-to-1 -- B-PER and B-PER drew each other a second time . " When I saw the new draw I did n't have to change my preparation , " B-PER said . " I think it 's destined that it turned out for me . " TENNIS - WEDNESDAY 'S RESULTS FROM THE B-MISC I-MISC .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-27 It was n't supposed to be this hard for defending champion B-PER I-PER to win her opening match at the B-MISC I-MISC on Tuesday night . But the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by 29th-ranked B-MISC B-PER I-PER playing with nothing to lose abandon . B-PER , of course , prevailed 6-3 7-6 , but not before some tense moments that even had the B-MISC superstar thinking the match was going three sets . " I won the second set , which I did n't think I would do , being down 5-2 and the chances she had at 6-5 , " B-PER recalled . Several of the other women 's seeds eased into the second round with more typical B-MISC efficiency Tuesday . As afternoon turned to evening , fourth-seeded B-MISC B-PER I-PER took apart B-MISC B-PER I-PER in 58 minutes with the loss of just two games , one more than second seed B-PER I-PER , who opened the second-day programme by crushing B-MISC B-PER I-PER 6-0 6-1 . Third seed B-PER I-PER I-PER , the 1994 champion , and eighth-seeded B-MISC gold medalist B-PER I-PER dropped three game each en route to the second round . But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women 's side . Fifth-seed B-PER I-PER of B-LOC was picked off by B-MISC B-PER I-PER and B-MISC semifinalist B-PER I-PER of B-LOC , the 10th seed , fell 6-2 7-5 to 53rd-ranked B-MISC B-PER I-PER . B-PER 's defeat left no other seeded players in B-PER 's quarter of the draw , which lost B-PER I-PER ( 6 ) and B-PER I-PER ( 12 ) on Monday . But B-PER , winner of 20 B-MISC I-MISC titles , was not about to join that list . " At some points I felt a little nervous , " she admitted . " When it came down to the important points , I felt more confident . " B-PER , a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year , was clearly going for winners , hitting the lines and running B-PER around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking 5-2 lead . B-PER ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order . But B-PER , her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots , held her serve and twice had set point on B-PER 's serve at 6-5 before the B-MISC unleashed a forehand pass to force the tie-break . " I lost the moment , " lamented B-PER , who has reached the fourth round at B-LOC four times and was a semifinalist in B-LOC earlier this month . Still , the feisty B-MISC got off to a 3-0 lead in the tie-breaker before a pair of costly double faults gave B-PER her chance to avoid a third set . " Usually in the first one or two matches , you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it , " said B-PER , who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker . " To be in that situation today , a couple of times having to play well , get down and play point-by-point , definitely is a good start . " BASEBALL - B-PER HAS SURGERY , OUT UP TO SIX WEEKS . B-LOC 1996-08-27 B-ORG I-ORG right fielder B-PER I-PER underwent surgery on Monday to remove a fractured bone from his right hand and will miss four to six weeks , the club announced Tuesday . B-PER , a leading candidate for B-MISC I-MISC B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC honours , was injured August 20th when he was hit by a B-PER I-PER pitch in the first inning of an 8-1 victory over the B-ORG I-ORG . The 27-year-old B-PER leads the league with 40 homers and is tied for 10th with 100 B-MISC . The loss of B-PER , who appeared in all 124 games this season , is a huge blow to the B-ORG ' playoff hopes . SOCCER - B-PER HAT-TRICK KEEPS B-ORG AT TOP OF B-MISC LEAGUE . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC striker B-PER scored a hat-trick as B-ORG I-ORG maintained their 100 percent record and stayed on top of the B-MISC first division with a 3-1 win at B-LOC on Wednesday . B-ORG 's main rivals for the title , defending champions B-ORG I-ORG , celebrated the novelty of having the roof of their new 51,000 seat stadium closed against the rain , with a 1-0 win over B-ORG I-ORG . B-ORG were missing six first-team players but B-PER I-PER I-PER shot home the winner from a 20-metre free kick in the 30th minute of a dull game . B-PER , signed in close season to replace compatriot B-PER who left to play for B-ORG , opened the B-ORG scoring in the 19th minute when he fired home after good work from B-PER I-PER . The B-MISC found the mark again two minutes after halftime and again in the 56th minute before midfielder B-PER I-PER scored a consolation goal for B-ORG five minutes from time . B-ORG I-ORG suffered an early shock when they went 1-0 down after four minutes against de B-ORG I-ORG . The equaliser came in the 73rd minute when B-MISC international B-PER I-PER scored from close range and 10 minutes later B-PER I-PER I-PER gave B-ORG a 2-1 victory from the penalty spot . After three matches B-ORG lead the first division with nine points , three points clear of fifth-placed B-ORG . SOCCER - B-PER WINS FIRST TROPHY WITH B-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-28 Former B-LOC manager B-PER I-PER enjoyed his first success in charge of B-ORG as his team weathered 90 minutes of non-stop B-ORG I-ORG pressure to win the B-MISC B-MISC I-MISC 6-5 on aggregate on Wednesday . B-ORG had won the first leg 5-2 but the second leg was a different story . B-ORG came within a whisker of taking the B-MISC on the away-goal rule but squandered several chances after going 3-1 ahead 15 minutes from the end . B-PER I-PER gave B-ORG the lead midway through the first half after B-ORG fullback B-PER I-PER and substitute goalkeeper B-PER I-PER failed to clear a B-PER I-PER cross . B-ORG 's B-PER I-PER made his only significant contribution of the evening 10 minutes after halftime when B-PER I-PER broke down the right to set up the fiery B-MISC with a simple equaliser . But B-ORG struck back almost immediately through new signing B-PER I-PER I-PER and then B-MISC set-piece specialist B-PER made it 3-1 with a superb free-kick in the 75th minute . B-PER praised B-ORG after the game , which was played in the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the B-PER B-LOC ground . The venue of B-ORG 's first league game , scheduled for Sunday , is still in doubt with the B-ORG I-ORG 's B-LOC I-LOC a distinct possibility . SOCCER - SUMMARY OF B-MISC B-MISC I-MISC .

SOCCER - B-ORG , B-ORG AND B-ORG OUT OF B-MISC I-MISC . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC I-MISC hopefuls B-ORG and B-ORG , under new coaches this season , crashed out of the B-MISC I-MISC to second division opponents on Wednesday while league champions B-ORG could only draw 1-1 at humble B-ORG . Wealthy B-ORG , now coached by the former B-MISC international B-PER I-PER , were without new striker B-PER I-PER and went down 3-1 at serie B club B-ORG in their second round clash . B-ORG 's B-PER I-PER shattered B-ORG with goals in the second and fourth minutes . Midfielder B-PER I-PER made it 3-0 in the 38th minute and B-ORG 's B-PER I-PER pulled back a late goal six minutes from time . The second round was the entry point for the bulk of the B-MISC I-MISC sides with the winners going through . The later stages of the cup are played over two legs . B-ORG 's defeat was a repeat of last season 's fiasco when they lost their opening cup match 3-0 to B-ORG . B-ORG , now coached by B-MISC B-PER I-PER and watched by B-MISC national coach B-PER I-PER , lost 3-1 to B-ORG -- another repeat of last season when the B-LOC club also went out at the first hurdle . B-ORG , with B-LOC 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC hero B-PER I-PER in their lineup , completed the hat-trick of beaten B-MISC I-MISC sides when they went under 2-1 to newly relegated B-ORG . B-ORG 's new B-MISC coach B-PER I-PER avoided the nightmare of defeat but faces a replay at home next Sunday . B-MISC holders B-ORG easily beat B-ORG 3-1 while B-MISC I-MISC holders B-ORG also cruised through with a 2-0 win at small southern club B-ORG I-ORG . Two other B-MISC I-MISC sides lost at the weekend -- B-ORG and last year 's losing finalists B-ORG . Two cup matches could not be played on Wednesday due to argument over first round results . B-ORG 's 3-0 weekend defeat of B-ORG was expected to be overturned by a sporting judge on Thursday after the home club fielded an ineligible player . That would set B-ORG up for a second round match against local rivals B-ORG . B-ORG 's 4-3 defeat of B-ORG was also subject to a complaint , later removed , that forced their second round match against B-MISC I-MISC newcomers B-ORG to be delayed .

B-MISC midfielder B-PER I-PER put B-ORG ahead in the 25th minute but B-PER I-PER equalised just a minute later . A header from B-PER and an acrobatic strike from B-PER gave B-ORG a two-goal cushion at halftime . But the pick of the 13-times champions ' goals came from B-PER I-PER , who beat three defenders to put B-ORG 4-1 up . B-PER I-PER hit a consolation goal for B-ORG . B-ORG I-ORG brought B-ORG 's 100 percent record to an end with a 2-0 win over the B-MISC club while a B-PER I-PER hat-trick inside seven minutes stood out in B-ORG 's 4-0 demolition of B-ORG I-ORG .

B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC I-MISC star B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC I-LOC scored at the last second for B-ORG , allowing them to retain the lead in the B-MISC soccer league on Wednesday . B-PER pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a 3-2 victory over B-ORG , who were leading 2-1 until B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER equalised on a header in the 85th minute . The win was the fourth in as many matches this season for B-ORG , who lead the table on 12 points . In-form B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , who dismissed B-ORG 1-0 , are second with 10 points . Along with B-PER , B-PER I-PER was the star of the night in B-LOC , scoring the first hat-trick of the league season in B-ORG 's 3-1 home victory over neighbouring B-ORG . B-PER , one of the most promising strikers in the country , was called up for the first time this week by B-MISC manager B-PER I-PER for a friendly against B-LOC on Saturday at the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC . B-PER scored first with a powerful shot in the 35th minute before striking again from close range just before the break . A solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the 74th . B-PER 's goal was as hard-won as his team 's victory . Spurred by B-PER 's leveller five minutes before , B-ORG pressed hard and B-PER hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header . The ball bounced back to B-PER 's feet and he scored . B-ORG seized an unexpected lead thanks to B-PER I-PER in the fourth minute after a blunder from B-ORG goalkeeper B-PER I-PER . The side from northern B-LOC , forced to fight an uphill battle from then on , pulled level thanks to B-PER I-PER in the eighth minute but young striker B-PER I-PER made it two for B-ORG five minutes later . League favourites B-ORG scored a convincing 1-0 win over B-ORG and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season . Ironically , B-ORG 's victory owed a lot to two former B-ORG players , striker B-PER I-PER , who scored on a brilliant shot in the 33rd minute , and defender B-PER I-PER , who started the one-two which allowed B-PER to score . The B-MISC , who have yet to concede a goal , were without B-LOC 's B-PER and B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER , both called up by their national sides . For B-ORG , who shocked B-ORG to win the league crown two years ago , the fall is very painful . B-ORG I-ORG , who lost most of their key players within two years , have yet to win a match this season . Reigning champions B-ORG had to settle for a goalless draw against B-ORG on Tuesday .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-28 Organisers hope to persuade B-LOC 's former B-MISC 100 metres champion B-PER I-PER to join a " B-ORG I-ORG " sprint relay in a special tribute to B-PER I-PER at Friday 's B-LOC grand prix . B-PER , who is retiring from international competition at the end of the season , was not due to compete in the B-MISC capital but B-LOC promoter B-PER I-PER said : " We are still hopeful of getting him to come . " B-PER has managed to get most of the B-MISC 100 metres champions since 1948 to attend the meeting , which is being held in the stadium where B-PER won four gold medals 60 years ago at the B-LOC B-MISC . B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER , the B-MISC 100 metres champion and world record holder , and Namibian B-PER I-PER , the silver medallist at the recent B-LOC B-MISC , have already agreed to run in the 4X100 metres team . B-PER said on Wednesday that he had also asked B-MISC 200 and 400 champion B-PER I-PER to run as well as B-PER . " Most of the B-MISC champions of the past are coming including B-LOC 's ( 1980 champion ) B-PER I-PER . B-PER belongs to them . It would be great to have him here . " There is a good offer .... My minimum would be that he just ran the relay , " he said . The 36-year-old B-MISC is still considering the offer and is expected to announce his decision later on Wednesday . B-PER 's widow B-PER is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out during the meeting and one of the sprinter 's relatives is expected to attend . The relay race , which will include squads from B-LOC , the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC as well as the B-PER ' quartet , will be held at the end of the meeting . Organisers had hoped to include 1984 and 1988 champion B-PER I-PER in the squad but he injured himself in B-LOC last Friday . CRICKET - NEW CAPTAIN B-PER UPSTAGED BY 120 FROM B-PER . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-PER I-PER marked his debut as B-MISC captain with a patient 110 on Wednesday , but was upstaged by dashing B-MISC I-MISC opener B-PER I-PER whose 120 steered the world champions to a nine-wicket B-MISC I-MISC win . B-LOC I-LOC , playing in front of their home crowd for the first time since winning the B-MISC I-MISC last March , comfortably passed B-LOC 's modest 226-5 from 50 overs in 44.2 overs . The devastating opening pair of B-PER and B-PER I-PER shared a fine first wicket stand of 129 to the delight of the 25,000 fans . B-PER , whose first 50 included three sixes and three fours , went on to an unbeaten 120 and the man-of-the-match award . B-PER , slow in comparison , was bowled by B-PER for 53 , but B-PER I-PER I-PER with 49 not out helped see B-LOC I-LOC home . Earlier , B-PER completed his ninth century in one-day cricket , taking 138 balls to do it before being run out . The rest of the B-MISC batting was generally tied down by brilliant fielding and some fairly tight bowling , although ex-captain B-PER I-PER chipped in with 58 , adding 129 with B-PER off 28 overs , before being stumped . The next match in the four-nation tournament is on Friday when B-LOC I-LOC play B-LOC in a repeat of the B-MISC I-MISC final in B-LOC where B-LOC I-LOC won by seven wickets .

PRESS DIGEST - B-LOC - AUG 28 . B-LOC 1996-08-28 These are the leading stories in the B-MISC press on Wednesday . B-ORG has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG - B-PER I-PER , the B-LOC Under-Secretary of State for International Organisations , will on Wednesday continue his work in B-LOC visiting B-LOC , where he should be received by B-PER I-PER , leader of B-ORG . On Tuesday B-PER participated in a meeting of a joint-commission where he considered that the B-MISC politicians should advance faster and find a way to cooperate . In his opinion the quartering of B-ORG forces must be concluded in all the B-MISC territory and the troops must be selected and integrated in the armed forces , the government forces must be concentrated in the principal units and the free circulation of people and goods must be reality in all the country . B-MISC TRUTH BODY TO SUMMON APARTHEID POLICE . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC I-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Wednesday it would subpoena persons accused of human rights violations to appear before it . " We can subpoena anyone we want to , even the president of the country , " spokesman B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . " Subpoenas are due to be served on a number of people this week . " Media reports have speculated that the commission , which is trying to heal the wounds of apartheid by confronting the past , could subpoena apartheid-era President B-PER I-PER and former police generals B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER . In submissions last week to the commission B-ORG I-ORG leader and former president B-PER I-PER I-PER said he had received no co-operation from B-PER in compiling his party 's report . Since it began work in April the commission has been hearing harrowing tales from the victims of apartheid-era abuses , by both the white minority regime and its opponents . It also wants to hear from those who committed the abuses , to whom it can offer amnesty in return for frankness . Hopes that reformed perpetrators would come forward voluntarily have faded but the commission has the legal power to force them to appear . B-PER declined to give say who would be subpoenaed . " At the moment we have a preliminary list of less than 10 people , but this is just the beginning , " he said .

The tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG violated the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC by allowing B-ORG the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug B-MISC .

One analyst said sales of B-MISC had already cut into B-MISC market share . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's analyst B-PER I-PER said , " B-ORG sales are losing share like mad ... my understanding of the marketplace is that they 're below expectations . " He added B-ORG I-ORG reported its sales of inventory to B-ORG was down . B-ORG makes B-MISC ; B-ORG markets it , he said . B-ORG , in its B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG quarterly report for the period ending June 30 , said it had earned $ 6.1 million from B-MISC sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market . When it approved B-MISC in May , the B-ORG said both B-ORG 's product and B-MISC were developed under the incentives of the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases .

B-PER I-PER , head of B-MISC B-ORG , told a news conference B-PER was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one B-MISC woman .

The B-MISC police are also investigating visits by about 10 B-MISC women , aged 17 to 22 , to B-LOC , at the invitation of B-PER . The women said they went to B-LOC voluntarily and police suspect they were used to act in pornographic films , B-PER said earlier this week . But he added they had difficulty remembering what happened during their visits to B-LOC , perhaps because of drugs , and were unsure whether they were filmed for pornography . B-PER , 39 , who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two girls aged 14 and 12 , is also suspected in the disappearance of Belgians B-PER I-PER , 19 , and B-PER I-PER , 17 , who went missing a year ago . Knifeman kills B-MISC beauty queen , wounds husband . B-LOC 1996-08-28 A man knifed to death international model B-PER I-PER outside her home in B-LOC , western B-LOC , B-MISC television said on Wednesday . The man , who said he had once been engaged to her , first knifed B-PER 's husband in the leg , then stabbed her three times in the chest when she tried to intervene during the incident on Tuesday . She died in hospital . B-PER , who was 24 and had a three-year-old child , was B-MISC I-MISC in 1991 and went on to a B-MISC modelling career that included working with B-MISC designer B-PER I-PER and B-ORG magazine , the B-ORG I-ORG newspaper said . She had been due to fly on a B-ORG airliner which exploded near B-LOC I-LOC last month , but had cancelled her booking , the newspaper said . Her attacker , identified only as B-PER I-PER , 36 , was arrested by police and will appear in court on Thursday morning , television reported . It said he had admitted the attack but had denied intending to kill B-PER . B-MISC shares slip in thin volume . B-LOC 1996-08-28 Leading B-MISC shares edged down on Wednesday in thin volume in the absence of B-MISC orders , traders said . The B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC index of 21 issues fell 1.64 percent to 180.38 on volume of $ 4.38 million . " The market was extremely quiet today , some profit-taking locally , no B-MISC orders , " said B-PER I-PER , director of sales and trade at B-ORG . " We are just a bit lower with a lot of inactivity during the whole day . " B-PER I-PER , managing director at B-ORG I-ORG , said the volume of orders was four to five times lower than a week ago . As often , the most volume was in B-ORG . " Unified is one of the blue chips , which has more prospects than anybody else does , because they have B-MISC supposedly coming up , " B-PER said . B-ORG officials said last week the board had not yet approved the final version of its application to the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG to issue B-MISC . B-ORG fell to $ 0.0817 from $ 0.0822 at Tuesday 's close with 8.90 million shares changing hands . B-ORG was the loser of the day with prices closing at $ 0.300 , down from $ 0.355 on Tuesday and $ 0.445 on Monday . B-PER said uncertainty about when B-ORG would issue B-MISC and about whether shares from the B-MISC market could be converted into B-MISC had hurt prices . " B-MISC investors ... will be investing in B-MISC and I do not think people in B-LOC will be able to come up with the money for the underlying shares to drive the B-MISC shares to those levels , " B-PER said . B-ORG has also tightened the rules restricting shareholers ' rights to trade its shares . B-ORG closed at at $ 0.958 after $ 0.966 , B-ORG fell to $ 2.56 from $ 2.58 and B-ORG was $ 9.82 after $ 9.85 . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG , +7095 941 8520 B-LOC asks B-LOC to explain deportations . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC asked B-LOC on Wednesday to explain why it was deporting more B-MISC immigrants , Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER said . The B-MISC daily B-ORG I-ORG reported earlier that B-LOC had deported about 5,000 B-MISC in the last five days . " The B-ORG I-ORG is trying to find out from the B-MISC embassy why B-MISC refugees have been deported from B-LOC , " B-PER told B-ORG . B-LOC and B-LOC signed an accord in May to legalise the status of B-MISC immigrant workers , estimated at 350,000 , and remove a long-standing stumbling block in relations between the two B-LOC neighbours . B-MISC recover 75 pct of confiscated land . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC has restored ownership rights to pre-communist private owners of 75 percent of the arable land or around four million hectares , an B-ORG I-ORG official said on Wednesday . " So far 75 percent has been returned with the land restitution almost completed in some regions like B-LOC I-LOC but lagging behind in other areas , predominantly in the mountains , " the official told a news conference . The ministry has said that it planned to return 96.6 percent of the arable land or 5.2 million hectares to its original owners by the end of this year . A land reform act passed four years ago abolished B-MISC collective farms , allowing the return of 5.4 million hectares to original owners or their heirs . -- B-ORG I-ORG , ( ++359-2 ) 981 8569 B-MISC chancellor to meet B-PER Sept 7 - B-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC Chancellor B-PER I-PER , who spoke to President B-PER I-PER by telephone on Wednesday , plans a trip to B-LOC on September 7 and will visit B-PER at his vacation home near B-LOC , B-ORG news agency said . B-ORG , quoting B-PER press secretary B-PER I-PER , said B-PER and B-PER had discussed bilateral relations and international issues on the telephone . B-PER had told B-PER about efforts to find a political solution to the conflict in B-LOC 's breakaway B-LOC region , B-ORG added . B-PER , who left on vacation on Monday , is staying at an exclusive private hunting lodge some 100 km ( 60 miles ) from B-LOC . B-LOC has been one of the loudest critics of B-LOC 's military intervention in B-LOC , a 20-month-old conflict in which tens of thousands of people have been killed . Exiled B-MISC protest confusing voting rules . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC refugees in B-LOC , the first to vote last weekend in their country 's first post-war election , found the rules confusing and some had no idea who they voted for , refugees and officials said on Wednesday . " For the most part they really did n't understand what was going on , " the director of the B-LOC camp B-PER I-PER told B-ORG on Wednesday . " It was confusing , they had no experience of voting , many of the refugees are only semi-literate and none of them knew anything about the candidates , " he said . " They just voted along ethnic lines where they could . " The B-MISC election is set for September 14 and voting began on Wednesday for most of the 600,000 B-MISC living abroad . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which is running the election , allowed the ballot to be held on Sunday in four B-MISC refugee camps . Some B-MISC refugees among the 385 registered voters B-LOC 's largest camp B-LOC have written to the B-ORG complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the B-LOC I-LOC , where most B-MISC live . This was because their pre-war homes are now in the B-MISC territory , so they were voting for the national assembly of the B-LOC I-LOC , most of the candidates for which are B-MISC . For the foreign powers which back last year 's B-LOC peace agreement , the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their pre-war homes , B-MISC should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multi-ethnic state . But B-PER I-PER , one of the refugees who signed the letter of complaint , told B-ORG : " We only realised after voting that we were being denied the rights of other B-MISC I-MISC to choose our president . This vote seals the division of my country . " Under the election rules citizens vote for a three-man presidency and B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for all B-LOC and for assemblies and cantonal seats in either the B-LOC I-LOC or the B-LOC I-LOC . On Sunday voters in B-LOC also cast ballots for municipal councils but these will be invalidated following the cancellation of local elections by the B-ORG on Tuesday . B-PER I-PER , who also signed the letter , alleged that elderly voters were directed who to vote for by B-MISC translators who stood in the polling booth to help them . " Probably 100 refugees were shown where to put their cross , " he said . Seventy eight-year-old B-PER I-PER , a B-MISC I-MISC who has spent the last five years in B-LOC , told B-ORG she had cast her ballot because she 'd been told to by the camp authorities but had no idea who she voted for . " At first the organisers would n't let anyone help me but when they saw I did n't understand a young translator ringed the names I had to mark , " she said . " I do n't know who I voted for . " B-PER I-PER of the B-MISC office organising the elections on behalf of the B-ORG told B-ORG on Wednesday her office was studying the letter but said they had followed B-ORG instructions very carefully . " The envelopes , each with the five different voting slips , were sealed until voting and had written instructions on how to vote , " she said . " But of course those who could not read had to be shown . " B-LOC presidential race next round on Sept 20 . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC will hold the next round of an inconclusive state presidential race on September 20 , parliamentary officers of the B-MISC state ruled on Wednesday . This comes after three votes in the 101-strong parliament on Monday and Tuesday failed to give either incumbent B-PER I-PER or rival candidate B-PER I-PER the necessary 68 votes for a clear mandate . The outcome was a rebuff for B-PER , failing three times to win backing in his bid for a second term as head of state of the former B-MISC republic . Parliament 's press officer told B-ORG that Speaker B-PER I-PER will convene an electoral college involving 101 MPs and and 273 local government representatives on September 20 . Both B-PER , 67 , and B-PER , 68 will automatically be listed as candidates but the election will also be open to new nominations with the backing of any 21 members of the college . The winner has to secure a majority from the college within two rounds of voting otherwise the election will go back before the parliament . B-PER likely to fail on B-LOC - B-MISC minister . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC security chief B-PER I-PER faces an almost impossible task in B-LOC and is likely to be sidelined , B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER was reported as saying on Wednesday . According to best-selling daily B-ORG I-ORG , B-PER told the B-MISC parliament 's foreign affairs committee on Tuesday that the fact B-PER had been charged with resolving the conflict in B-LOC showed he would be marginalised . " It is almost impossible to gain success in this , " it quoted B-PER as saying during a committee debate . " B-PER has no diplomatic experience . B-PER sent him there to compromise him . This tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action , " he said . B-PER , who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern B-LOC region , was in B-LOC this week seeking support for a deal on B-LOC 's political status . But B-MISC President B-PER I-PER has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on Monday . B-ORG I-ORG quoted B-PER as saying B-PER was very ill and effectively on leave , but for now retained control in B-LOC although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators . B-PER said B-LOC 's July polls , in which B-PER won re-election , showed democracy had passed an important test and the B-MISC people had chosed the path of further reforms . But he said a power struggle in B-LOC 's ruling circles could not be ruled out , which could harm further reforms . He expressed concern over problems in the B-MISC economy , saying this could lead to social unrest , the daily reported . On B-LOC 's foreign policy , B-PER said it had changed its stance on B-ORG 's eastward expansion and was preparing itself for B-LOC 's inevitable entry into the B-MISC alliance . He also reportedly criticised B-MISC Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER , saying his style of work resembled that of the B-MISC 1970s and 1980s . B-LOC state budget soars in June . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC 's state budget deficit jumped sharply in June to 1,242.9 billion lei for the January-June period from 596.5 billion lei in January-May , official data showed on Wednesday . Six-month expenditures stood at 9.50 trillion lei , up from 7.56 trillion lei at end-May , with education and health spending accounting for 31.6 percent of state expenses and economic subsidies and support taking some 26 percent . January-June revenues went up to 8.26 trillion lei from 6.96 trillion lei in the first five months this year . B-LOC 's government is expected to revise the 1996 budget on Wednesday to bring it into line with higher inflation , new wage and pension indexations and costs of energy imports that have pushed up the state deficit . Under the revised version state spending is expected to rise by some 566 billion lei . No new deficit forecast has been issued so far . In July the government gave a 6.0-percent wage and pension indexation to cover energy , fuel and bread price increases , which quickened inflation to 7.5 percent last month . In the original state budget , approved in March , revenues were envisaged at around 16.98 trillion lei and expenditures 20.17 trillion lei for 1996 . The state budget deficit was originally forecast to be 3.19 trillion lei for the whole year . On Wednesday , the leu 's official rate was 3,161 to the dollar . -- B-ORG I-ORG 40-1 3120264 B-LOC I-LOC says B-MISC pair kidnapped by B-MISC . B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 The B-MISC I-MISC government said on Wednesday that a B-MISC couple abducted over the weekend from a tree farm in northern B-LOC I-LOC was kidnapped by former B-MISC guerrillas . " Even though it 's an act of common delinquency , the case could take a difficult turn because former B-MISC guerrillas are involved , " Security Minister B-PER I-PER told reporters . Earlier this year , a B-MISC tourist and a B-MISC tour guide were kidnapped from the same general area in northern B-LOC I-LOC near the B-MISC border . They were held for 71 days before relatives paid a ransom to free them . Two B-MISC former guerrillas have been arrested in the case . Because of the apparent threat to foreigners in B-LOC I-LOC near the B-MISC border , B-PER said the government has advised many to take additional security measures on their own . B-PER I-PER I-PER and his wife , B-PER I-PER I-PER , both 50 years old , were seized late on Saturday or early on Sunday from a teak tree plantation they manage by at least two heavily armed men who took the two off in their own car , leaving behind a ransom note demanding $ 1.5 million . The plantation is owned by B-MISC citizen B-PER I-PER , who has since arrived in B-LOC I-LOC to deal with the matter . Gov't dodging extradition , B-MISC official says . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 A top judicial official and critic of President B-PER I-PER accused the government of indifference on Wednesday over efforts to lift B-LOC 's five-year-old ban on extradition . " It would seem that the subject of extradition is unworthy of an opinion from the government , " Deputy Prosecutor-General B-PER B-LOC said . Constitutional reforms were proposed on Tuesday by two senators , one of them a member of B-PER 's own B-ORG I-ORG , aimed at lifting the ban on extradition introduced in 1991 . B-LOC Ambassador B-PER I-PER applauded the move , saying it could prompt the B-PER administration to remove B-LOC from a list of outcast nations that have failed to cooperate in B-LOC counternarcotics efforts . B-PER -- who weathered a year-old crisis stemming from charges he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money -- appeared less than enthusiastic , however . " Extradition is not on the government 's legislative agenda , " he told reporters on Tuesday . He added that he did not oppose the idea of opening a public debate over the issue . But he fell far short of endorsing the idea of putting B-MISC drug lords onto U.S.-bound flights to serve stiff penalities in B-MISC prisons . B-LOC , who spoke at a meeting on kidnapping in B-LOC , has said in the past that there was ample evidence to prove that B-PER 's campaign received millions of dollars in contributions from the country 's top drug lords . Quake shakes B-LOC I-LOC during B-PER visit . B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 A moderate earthquake measuring 5.0 on the B-PER scale shook B-LOC I-LOC on Wednesday during a visit by B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER , but there were no reports of casualties or damage , officials said . The quake struck at 11.16 a.m. ( 1716 B-MISC ) and was centred 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of the port of B-LOC , which is 90 miles ( 140 km ) south of the capital B-LOC I-LOC , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said . The quake was felt for about seven seconds in most of the country but preliminary reports said no one was hurt , it added . The quake took place a few minutes before the end of a welcoming ceremony at B-LOC I-LOC airport for B-PER , who was starting a three-hour visit as part of a B-MISC I-MISC tour . B-PER , who arrived at 11 a.m. ( 1700 B-MISC ) , showed no sign of having felt the quake , witnesses said . Barrier removed to B-LOC B-ORG sell-off . B-LOC 1996-08-28 The B-MISC B-ORG Wednesday agreed to shelve a bill linking the privatization of mining conglomerate B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG to congressional approval , officials said . Officials said the B-ORG vote removed all existing legislative hurdles in the way of B-ORG 's sell-off . The motion was put forward by B-LOC . B-PER I-PER I-PER , who had drawn up the bill . The B-ORG vote also annulled a substitute version of B-PER 's bill which had sought to dedicate revenue from B-ORG 's privatization to regional infrastructure projects . -- B-PER I-PER , B-LOC newsroom 55-61-2230358 B-ORG - B-ORG I-ORG year net B-MISC 6.1 mln .

B-ORG I-ORG calls for halt to contacts with B-LOC . B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG on Wednesday called for a halt to contacts with B-LOC , just hours after President B-PER I-PER said the B-MISC state had effectively declared war on the B-MISC by pursuing its hardline policies . A resolution released by the council called for " halting contacts with the B-MISC side and leaving the mechanism to carry out this to B-MISC President B-PER I-PER " . The council was meeting in B-LOC to discuss B-LOC 's new policy of B-MISC settlement expansion and its uncompromising line on B-LOC since Prime Minister B-PER I-PER took office in June . Council resolutions are not necessarily binding . B-PER had earlier blasted B-LOC saying its policies amounted to a declaration of war against the B-MISC people . He also called for the first general strike in two years in the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC on Thursday . " What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new B-MISC leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the B-MISC people , " B-PER told the council . Council speaker B-PER I-PER said the decision was part of a comprehensive plan to confront B-MISC settlement policy , land confiscation and what he termed other violations of the B-MISC peace deals . B-MISC I-MISC group says agrees new ceasefire . B-LOC 1996-08-28 An B-MISC I-MISC group on Wednesday said it had agreed a new B-MISC ceasefire with a rival faction after a previous accord was shattered by sporadic fighting between the groups in recent days . " The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) leadership declares its endorsement for a ceasefire arrangement with the B-ORG ( B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ) to take effect as of 8:00 a.m. on August 28 , " the B-ORG said in a statement . The B-ORG said the ceasefire was agreed after talks between B-LOC Assistant Secretary for B-LOC I-LOC Affairs B-PER I-PER and B-ORG leader B-PER I-PER . The B-ORG , led by B-PER I-PER , had said a previous ceasefire negotiated by B-PER last Friday was broken by the B-ORG . B-PER has agreed to take part in talks in B-LOC on reaching a comprehensive settlement for the B-MISC conflict , the B-ORG statement said . It said the B-ORG was responsible for breaking the previous ceasefire by refusing to endorse it publicly . B-MISC group says B-MISC troops massing near north . B-LOC 1996-08-28 An B-MISC I-MISC group on Wednesday said B-LOC was massing troops near B-MISC regions in the north , where a B-MISC allied air force protects the local population against attacks from B-LOC . " The B-MISC regime has started threatening the B-MISC population by massing troops in preparation to attack B-MISC towns and population centres , " the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said in a statement . The B-ORG said it had received confirmed reports that B-MISC troops , supported by tanks , artillery and armoured vehicles , have already penetrated some B-MISC areas . It said the military presence reflects cooperation between President B-PER I-PER and the B-ORG 's rival , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) . The B-ORG statement follows B-ORG assertions that the B-ORG is receiving military support from B-LOC . Hostilities between the two warring B-MISC I-MISC factions have continued in the last few days despite a B-MISC ceasefire last Friday . The B-ORG called on the B-ORG I-ORG and allied forces to halt the B-MISC aggression . B-LOC , B-MISC and B-MISC aircraft have safeguarded the B-MISC I-MISC population against aggression from B-LOC since shortly after the B-MISC I-MISC in 1991 . The allied force , known as B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , is based in southern B-LOC . B-LOC says hijackers were not diplomats . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC on Wednesday said the hijackers of a B-MISC airliner were not B-MISC diplomats and added that " noble B-MISC " would never contemplate such an action . The official B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) quoted B-LOC 's ambassador in B-LOC as saying that B-LOC 's embassy in the B-MISC capital had nothing to do with the Monday night hijacking . B-LOC 's ambassador in B-LOC denounced the hijacking and described it as a terrorist act which had nothing to do " with the morals and values of noble B-MISC , " B-ORG said . Ambassador B-PER I-PER I-PER told B-ORG there was only one diplomat among the 199 passengers and crew on the B-ORG I-ORG B-MISC . " He was not involved ... on the contrary he was harassed by the elements which carried out the hijacking , " he said . B-ORG did not say the hijackers were B-MISC . The hijack started when the flight left B-LOC for B-LOC on Monday night . The hijackers told the crew they had grenades and other explosives and threatened to blow up the plane if they were not taken to B-LOC . The airliner refuelled at B-LOC , B-LOC and landed at B-LOC 's B-LOC airport in the early hours of Tuesday . Seven B-MISC suspected hijackers surrendered and B-MISC police said they had apparently asked for political asylum . Several had brought their families along , including children . B-PER blasts B-PER for ignoring teen drug use . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC presidential candidate B-PER I-PER Wednesday accused the B-PER administration of ignoring drug use among teenagers and said if elected he would use the B-ORG I-ORG to stop drugs from entering the B-LOC I-LOC . " He 'll probably mention his war on drugs , which he 's going to start like everything else -- next year . It 's too late , Mr. President , " B-PER told an outdoor crowd of several hundred at a private religious school . He also commented briefly on published reports that the administration was planning to announce a plan to lower capital gains taxes for home sales . " Welcome to the club . We 've had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks , " B-PER said . B-PER said former first lady B-PER I-PER was laughed at with her " just say no " anti-drug message . " But it worked , " B-PER said . Meanwhile , in B-LOC I-LOC , B-PER 's running mate , B-PER I-PER , campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the 1992 B-LOC I-LOC riots . B-PER told a crowd of about 300 B-MISC I-MISC in south central B-LOC I-LOC , " Keep your eyes open , keep your ears open , keep your heart open . I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote . " In B-PER 's address to a group that was largely white , the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the B-LOC I-LOC to missiles aimed at B-MISC children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use . " They 're aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people , whether it 's a needle , whether it 's a cigarette , whatever the delivery system is -- it 's poison and it 's got to stop in B-LOC . " he said . B-PER said 70 percent of the cocaine that entered the B-LOC I-LOC and 40 percent of the marijuana came from B-LOC . " We 've got an international problem and I 'm prepared to use our military might . We want to stop drugs at the border , " he said . B-PER 's remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes . " I did n't say anything about cigarettes . I was talking about drugs . I said you should n't smoke either . That 's all I said , " he replied as he was shaking hands with well-wishers . When asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes , B-PER replied : " Oh no . Come on , you know better than that . " B-PER campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke . B-PER also said he opposed B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC which , if approved by voters , would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses . B-PER said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an ingrown toenail . In an effort to paint the drug issue in non-political terms , B-PER said three times during his 20-minute address that illegal drug use was neither a B-MISC nor a B-MISC issue but one that involves all people . The anti-drug message is a theme B-PER feels has strong voter appeal . On Sunday near B-LOC he accused President B-PER I-PER of " raising the white flag " in the war on drugs . A recent survey showed that illegal drug use among 12-17 year-olds had doubled in the past four years . B-PER was flanked by several B-LOC B-MISC politicians including Gov . B-PER I-PER , who said local and state governments cannot fight illegal drugs alone . " We need all the help we can get . We need to get the kind of help we used to get when B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER were in the B-LOC I-LOC , " B-PER said . B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC . , at $ 11 mln .

Random Lengths quoted cash spruce at $ 419 per tbf , up $ 5 from last Friday and $ 7 over the last midweek quote . Reduced concern over Hurricane B-MISC prompted some of the early profit taking .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC . 1996-08-28 Above-normal summer rainfall in the B-LOC B-LOC I-LOC has produced near-ideal conditions for planting the 1997 hard red winter wheat crop , analysts said Wednesday . From central B-LOC north to B-LOC , rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year . " Our moisture situation is excellent , especially for fall planting of winter wheat , " said B-PER I-PER , extension wheat marketing economist at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . The irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on B-LOC I-LOC wheat producers , who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the " B-MISC I-MISC " days of the 1930s . " It 's definitely a turnabout from this past year , but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year , and then about October 1 it quit , " said B-PER I-PER , executive director of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " Hopefully that 's not going to happen this year . " According to figures released by the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC , an average of 20.19 inches fell across the state between March 1 and August 26 , 1996 . That 's about 1/2 inch above the average for the same time period , according to B-PER I-PER , associate state climatologist at the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . He noted that the majority of that 20.19 inches had fallen since July . As an example of just how dry it was , data showed that between October 1 , 1995 and March 1 , 1996 , the state received an average of only 4.6 inches of rainfall . In northern B-LOC , the current rainfall situation was similar to most of B-LOC , said B-PER I-PER , executive assistant for the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " Up here in the B-LOC I-LOC , we 've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat , " B-PER said . But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern B-LOC , where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane B-MISC last week . In B-LOC , typically the number one B-LOC hard red winter wheat producer , topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday , according to the state 's agricultural statistics service . In its weekly report released Monday , the service said B-LOC topsoil moisture was rated eight percent surplus , 77 percent adequate and 15 percent short to very short . B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG showed similar conditions , rating topsoil moisture levels as seven percent surplus , 81 percent adequate and 12 percent short to very short . Data on topsoil moisture ratings were not released by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . -- B-PER I-PER , 816 561-8671 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG settles suit . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Wednesday it agreed to settle a class action law suit involving its collateral protection insurance ( B-MISC ) program . To provide for the settlements , B-ORG I-ORG has established a common fund of $ 4.7 million for cash refunds and $ 19.4 million in credit refunds for outstanding B-MISC balances . The bank is a division of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . The bank said most of the charges resulted from loan portfolios from banks and thrifts that were acquired in the 1980s . B-ORG I-ORG said it has discontinued B-MISC as an element of its motor vehicle or boat installment loan contracts . As part of the settlement agreement , customers who had B-MISC placed on loans from January 1 , 1986 to September 31 , 1996 , will receive cash or credit refunds , the bank said . Cash refunds will go to those who paid their loans to B-ORG I-ORG while credit refunds will go to those who have existing loan balances , the bank said . B-ORG says in talks over B-LOC oil acreage . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 B-ORG I-ORG officials said the company is in talks over crude oil production sharing in B-LOC , but declined to comment on a published report B-ORG had reached preliminary agreement on a block in the B-LOC area . " We 've been asked ( by B-LOC ) not to comment ( on the talks ) , " said B-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER . " We can neither confirm nor deny that report , " he said . According to B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) , B-LOC and B-ORG signed a " memorandum of understanding " for a production-sharing agreement in B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC B-MISC in the former B-LOC I-LOC , which united with B-LOC I-LOC in 1990 . According to another B-ORG official , the company is not exploring now for oil anywhere in B-LOC . The officials said B-ORG was deferring to the B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for any specific comments on the B-MISC talks . The former B-LOC I-LOC was displaced as contractor of the potentially rich B-LOC oilfields once it collapsed in December 1991 , according to the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG +1 212 859 1633 B-LOC defends military regime to hostile B-ORG . B-PER I-PER B-ORG I-ORG 1996-08-28 B-LOC 's ambassador on Wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by B-MISC states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his army-run government . In a lengthy debate on B-LOC before the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , Ambassador B-PER I-PER said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former B-MISC President B-PER I-PER . Nearly every B-MISC member who spoke , as well as most B-ORG I-ORG members , however , were unsympathetic towards the government of President B-PER I-PER , an army major put in power in a July coup by the B-MISC military , which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority B-MISC . " These ( B-MISC ) brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of B-LOC , " B-PER said of the economic embargo . " Quite the contrary , B-LOC has seen economic war declared against it by fellow B-MISC people ... a gratuitous immolation of the people of B-LOC . " He said his government had just asked B-ORG human rights monitors to increase their numbers in B-LOC in an effort " to put an end to this vicious circle of violence . " More than 150,000 people have been killed in violence between the minority B-MISC and the majority B-MISC since 1993 . B-LOC 's envoy , B-PER I-PER , said coups should be relegated " to the dump heap of history " as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government . B-LOC has proposed a resolution , still under discussion , that would impose an immediate arms embargo on B-LOC and call for negotiations . The draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution . Among the council 's five permanent members , B-LOC and the B-LOC I-LOC appeared to support most elements of the B-MISC proposal , while B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC were cautious . B-PER , a B-MISC , said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against B-MISC guerrillas and leave the population exposed to " armed terroritsts . " But B-MISC Ambassador B-PER I-PER said : " Every weapon that reached B-LOC is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian . We must not send a signal different from the B-MISC leaders themselves . Inaction is becoming the worst possible course of action . " B-LOC 's parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but B-PER told reporters B-PER would reconvene a new type of national assembly in October . The B-LOC I-LOC said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued . Ambassador B-PER I-PER said the new government should have " unconditional " negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country . He said B-LOC strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider " an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders . " But he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring B-LOC , where widespread genocide broke out against the B-MISC two years ago . He again said the B-ORG I-ORG should draw up contingency plans for a rapid humanitarian intervention . B-MISC arrest B-MISC on genocide suspicion . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC authorities said on Wednesday they had arrested a former B-MISC mayor , now living in B-LOC , on suspicion of violating human rights during the genocide in his country in 1994 . The B-ORG I-ORG said in a statement that investigations were still in the preliminary stage but it was cooperating closely with police in the cantons of B-LOC and B-LOC .

He said the market began strong , gave up some gains at midday and then was able to recover back at the close , but all on light volume . In the primary market , B-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG launched issues for 100 million and 300 million B-MISC francs , respectively . B-ORG ' seven-year issue was quoted at a yield of 3.98 percent , and B-ORG I-ORG 's five-year issue was quoted at 3.60 percent . B-MISC money market rates remained lower at around 1.75 percent offered . As to fundamentals , economists at B-ORG I-ORG said they expect the country 's gross domestic product to be flat to negative in 1996 , and to grow only 0.6 percent in 1997 . The B-MISC government also said Wednesday it had made progress in cutting B-LOC 's projected spending for 1997 . B-LOC reports July consumer prices later this week .

" From here we will march to B-LOC and by B-PER we will not let B-PER and ( B-PER 's husband B-PER I-PER ) B-PER escape justice , " B-PER I-PER , leader of the main opposition B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG told a rally organised by a 16-party alliance . B-PER accused B-PER of corruption and nepotism , charges she has denied in the past . Witnesses said protesters carrying colourful party flags walked for several miles , chanting anti-government slogans . The event was part of an opposition campaign launched on August 14 , B-LOC 's independence day . B-PER said similar rallies would be held in the B-LOC provincial capital B-LOC and the B-LOC provincial capital B-LOC before an opposition march on the capital B-LOC . " I promise the people of B-LOC that those responsible for the extra-judicial killing of innocent youths would not be spared , " B-PER said . B-LOC 's ethnic B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) accuses the government of killing many of its militants in cold blood . The government has denied the charge and blames the B-ORG for much of the violence that killed 2,000 people in the city last year . Political observers said the turn-out was disappointing for a city of about 12 million people , possibly indicating that the B-ORG , although a member of the opposition alliance , had not mobilised its supporters for the event . The turbulent southern port has been calmer this year , but police say more than 300 people have died in political unrest . The B-ORG speaks for B-MISC I-MISC who migrated from B-LOC at B-LOC in 1947 and their descendants . B-PER , a former prime minister , is the main political rival of B-PER , who defeated him in the October 1993 election . He said only the removal of the government and an early election could save B-LOC from disaster . " We will dislodge the B-PER government . It is a holy war for us , " he said . B-PER has vowed to complete her five-year term . B-LOC B-ORG Apr-Jul ' 96 sales , output up . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC 's leading cement firm B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said on Wednesday its cement sales rose to 3.1 million tonnes in April-July 1996 from 2.93 million a year ago . B-ORG Chairman B-PER I-PER told shareholders at the firm 's annual meeting cement output rose to 3.14 million tonnes in the first quarter of 1996/97 ( April-March ) , from 3.01 million a year ago . B-PER said B-ORG had secured government approval to take over a sick cement firm with a grinding capacity of 275,000 tonnes per year . " We will take it over early next month , " he said . Talking about the cement industry in general , B-PER said B-MISC production rose by about 10 percent in 1995/96 . " The industry saw capacity expansion of about 13 percent over 1994/95 from 77.79 million tonnes to 87.45 million tonnes , " B-PER told shareholders . He said B-MISC cement exports dropped about eight percent from the previous year because of stiff international competition and inadequate infrastructural facilities . B-ORG 's own export performance was marginally better than in 1994/95 on account of a 36 percent rise in exports to B-LOC and the opening of a new market - B-LOC I-LOC , he said . Despite power shortages , B-ORG achieved a satisfactory growth in production during the year with the help of its power plants . B-ORG sold 9.4 million tonnes in 1995/96 , retaining its top position in the B-MISC cement industry , B-PER said . -- B-LOC newsroom +91-22-265 9000 B-LOC bank sanctions $ 6.5 mln loan to B-LOC B-ORG .

The loan is at B-MISC plus one percent , it said . The loan , maturing in six years , is guaranteed by B-ORG I-ORG for $ 3.5 million and by B-ORG I-ORG for $ 3 million , it said . The B-ORG plant , located in the western B-MISC state of B-LOC , will have a capacity to manufacture 175,000 tonnes per annum of longitudinal pipes and 25,000 tonnes per annum of spiral welded pipes , the statement said . The longitudinal pipes plant is expected to be complete by the second quarter of September 1997 and the saw arc welded pipes plant by September 1996 , it said . B-ORG is part of the B-ORG group which has a presence in the cotton yarn , terry towels and polyester yarn industry , the statement said . -- B-LOC newsroom +91-22-265 9000 B-LOC fishermen say forced to carry B-MISC refugees . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC fishermen said on Wednesday they had been forced at gunpoint to ferry refugees fleeing the ethnic war in B-LOC I-LOC to B-LOC , as a protest strike by more than 30,000 fishermen entered its ninth day . " There is little we can do when at mid-sea . The B-ORG ( B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ) accosts us and , at the point of a gun , forces us to take refugees , " said senior fishermen leader B-PER I-PER . Some 850 refugees have landed in recent weeks at the port of B-LOC in the southern B-MISC state of B-LOC I-LOC , home to 50 million B-MISC people , port officials say . B-LOC is 15 km ( 10 miles ) off the coast of B-LOC I-LOC . State chief minister B-PER I-PER has publicly welcomed the refugees , who are fleeing the 13-year war between B-MISC separatists and government troops that B-LOC says has cost 50,000 lives . But the influx has triggered fears of a repeat of the 1980s when some 200,000 refugees landed in B-LOC I-LOC . Intelligence officals said more than 5,000 B-MISC were waiting on the western coast of B-LOC I-LOC to cross into B-LOC . The B-MISC government has warned its fishermen that their boats would be impounded if they were caught ferrying refugees . The fishermen went on strike last week to protest the government 's cancellation of three trawlers ' fishing licenses after the boats were caught carrying B-MISC refugees . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG secretary B-PER I-PER said the strike would continue indefinitely and the fishermen would block road and rail traffic if their demands were not met . " Until the government releases our boats from naval custody and B-MISC I-MISC naval custody , and gives us assurance ( it will not revoke licences of boats ferrying refugees ) , we will not call off our strike , " B-PER said . B-ORG spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment , but B-MISC I-MISC fishermen denied that B-MISC were being coerced into carrying refugees across the B-LOC I-LOC . " B-MISC fishermen come right up to B-LOC to fish , and when refugees request them to ferry them across , they readily oblige . Only some take money , " B-MISC I-MISC boatman B-PER said . B-PER denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to B-LOC and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees ' arrival . " We have not gone to sea since August 19 , but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless . How could we alone be held responsible for the influx ? " he said . An B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG official said the government planned to urge fishermen not to cross the international boundary between B-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC , but admitted this would be hard to enforce because of B-LOC I-LOC 's pomfret-rich waters . B-MISC cotton trade shut for local festival . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC 's cotton trade was shut on Wednesday for a local religious festival , dealers said . Trading will resume on Thursday . On Tuesday , cotton prices fell on profit-taking prompted by increased offerings from state agencies .

B-PER will depart for B-LOC on Saturday afternoon . Prime Minister B-PER I-PER criticized B-PER today for unleashing a seven-point economic package that offers tax relief to merchants and other professionals , higher pensions to farmers and support for small business . The finance ministry estimated the cost of B-ORG 's economic measures to over 600 billion drachmas but B-ORG officials put the figure much lower to about 300 billion drachmas . B-PER blamed B-ORG for the low absorption rate of B-ORG funds and said the socialists will increase farmers ' pensions , combat tax evasion and accelerate GDP growth rates to 4.0 percent in a few years . Faster economic growth is a major component of B-ORG 's economic programme and B-PER has repeatedly blamed the socialists for the slow economic growth . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG +301 3311812-4 B-MISC pushes B-LOC stocks to new record . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-28 A firm start on B-LOC I-LOC helped push leading B-LOC shares to a new record high on Wednesday and B-MISC stocks closed floor trading up but the B-LOC bourse slipped sharply , hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest . On the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected B-MISC business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade . B-LOC shares , boosted by B-LOC I-LOC , added to early gains with the blue chip B-MISC I-MISC index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly . One focus was B-ORG I-ORG , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of " open skies " talks between the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and the B-MISC government may jeopardise its tie-up with B-ORG I-ORG . The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the B-LOC . Better-than-expected B-MISC trade figures had little impact on equities . The B-MISC July trade deficit totalled 506 million sterling ( $ 788 million ) while June 's world deficit was 1.12 billion pounds . Forecasts were for deficits of 900 million sterling and 1.4 billion sterling . B-MISC shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar . The 30-share B-MISC index closed at 2,563.16 points , up 4.32 . However , B-MISC stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading , falling through the 2000 point resistance level on the main B-MISC index . Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 1997 budget and possible autumn strikes B-PER I-PER , leader of B-LOC 's B-MISC B-ORG union , criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as B-LOC gets back to work after the holidays . Later in the day , helped by the firmer B-LOC I-LOC opening , B-LOC climbed back to the 2000 level but still remained well into negative territory . In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 108.40 yen in the B-MISC afternoon , up from its B-MISC close on Tuesday of 107.55 but off the day 's highs . It had been boosted overnight by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's quarterly corporate survey , or " tankan " , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment . The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that B-MISC interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen . The B-MISC discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent . The B-ORG sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year . A B-ORG spokesman said " the doors to the recovery have not been shut ... the recovery is still continuing . " These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further . " The dollar 's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised B-MISC rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely , " said currency economist B-PER I-PER . Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC President B-PER I-PER said on Wednesday that B-LOC had declared war on the B-MISC and called for the first general strike in the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC in two years . " What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new B-MISC leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the B-MISC people , " B-PER told the B-MISC legislature . Accusing B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER of stupidity , B-PER launched his strongest attack on the right-wing government since its election in May . The tirade was sparked by B-LOC 's announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the B-MISC settlement of B-LOC I-LOC and its demolishing of a community centre in B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC . " B-LOC has started the war on B-LOC . They are idiots to have started the B-LOC battle , " B-PER said in B-MISC . " There will be no B-MISC state without B-LOC . B-PER should know he is stupid to have started this battle . " B-PER called for a general strike " for B-LOC " on Thursday in all of the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC . There has not been a joint shutdown there since May 1994 when B-MISC troops began withdrawing under an interim self-rule agreement signed in 1993 . The strike will have little effect on the B-MISC economy while hurting B-MISC merchants in B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC who cater to the tourist trade . Some 25,000 B-MISC labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs , mainly in construction , in B-LOC . But B-MISC , once the backbone of the building industry , have been largely replaced by labourers from B-LOC and B-LOC . " On Friday , all B-MISC , including B-MISC in B-LOC ... will go to ( B-LOC 's ) B-LOC mosque and pray . B-MISC and B-MISC who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them , " B-PER said . Officials in B-PER 's office were not immediately available for comment on B-PER 's remarks . B-MISC travel restrictions , imposed after bombings by B-MISC militants in February and March , ban most of the two million B-MISC in the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC from entering B-LOC . B-PER , who opposes trading occupied land for peace , made B-LOC a central issue in his election campaign , accusing B-ORG Prime Minister B-PER I-PER of planning to hand control of the B-MISC eastern part of the city to the B-MISC . B-LOC captured B-LOC I-LOC in the 1967 B-LOC I-LOC war and claims both halves of the city as its capital . The B-ORG wants B-LOC I-LOC as the capital of a future B-MISC state . In his speech to the crowded legislature , B-PER signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although " alarm bells are ringing " . He unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC envoy B-PER I-PER , who held talks in B-LOC on Tuesday with B-MISC and B-MISC officials .

B-LOC 1996-08-27 Former B-LOC B-MISC Gov . B-PER I-PER has decided not to endorse B-PER I-PER as the presidential candidate of the B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG reported late Tuesday . B-ORG quoted aides and family members as saying B-PER , who competed with B-PER to head the ticket for B-PER 's party , had told them he would definitely not endorse B-PER , but they did not know whether he would endorse another candidate . An announcement was planned in B-LOC Wednesday .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-27 B-LOC investors in troubled B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a B-LOC court decision in favour of B-ORG I-ORG and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions . A B-LOC appeals court on Tuesday gave B-ORG I-ORG a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse . A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered B-ORG I-ORG to give investors , known as B-MISC , more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan . " My prediction is that the B-MISC will appeal , " said B-PER I-PER , a B-LOC B-MISC and a chief negotiator for the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " At this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that I 'm confident that they will appeal , " he said . " But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court 's ruling is . " Under the reorganisation plan , B-ORG I-ORG plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called B-ORG . The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund B-ORG but also provides them with 3.2 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities . The B-MISC had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 1100 B-MISC Wednesday , but B-ORG I-ORG chairman B-PER I-PER said on Tuesday the offer would be extended . At least eight B-LOC states have still some form of litigation pending , said B-PER I-PER , spokesman for the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG State Chairmen , a group representing B-LOC B-MISC . " It goes without saying that we 're rather disappointed , " B-PER said of the decision by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for the B-ORG I-ORG , sitting in B-LOC . But , he said , " we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this . " The B-LOC attorney general told B-ORG I-ORG last week it was considering a new legal action against the B-MISC insurance market , based on allegations of consumer fraud . " We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response , " said B-LOC attorney general B-PER I-PER . B-PER said she was concerned that the B-ORG I-ORG agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding B-ORG and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of B-LOC . In addition , she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional , future liabilities . Meanwhile , an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some 600 B-MISC in B-LOC is still pending before the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for the B-ORG I-ORG , B-PER of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said . That lawsuit , which seeks rescision and restitution , was dismissed in a B-LOC district court . That case " is what I call the most significant alternate remedy for us , " B-PER said . The individual B-MISC , however , now must decide whether to accept B-ORG I-ORG settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation . B-PER said he has advised B-MISC that " they must make , individually , a risk benefit analysis . " Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing B-ORG I-ORG two to three times more than B-ORG I-ORG is now willing to accept , he said . But , in rejecting the offer , the B-MISC would retain their rights to pursue litigation , he said . B-MISC police made B-MISC gestures , officials say . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC riot police made B-MISC gestures at a private function earlier this month and may face dismissal for their actions , the B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG said on Wednesday . The ministry declined to detail gestures the B-MISC policemen had made at the August 13 function but added seven had been suspended from duty pending an internal inquiry . A spokesman for public prosecutors in the southern city , where dictator B-PER I-PER held some of his most infamous B-MISC party rallies in the 1930s , said there were no plans to prosecute the officers as the gestures had not been made in public . Gun-wielding motorist snapped by cool passenger . B-LOC 1996-08-28 A motorist threatened a fellow driver with a starting pistol as he overtook him illegally in the inside lane on a motorway near B-LOC and was photographed in the act by the driver 's wife , prosecutors said on Wednesday . Prosecutors in the city of B-LOC said the 32-year-old man drew alongside the other car at about 110 kph ( 70 mph ) and aimed his pistol at the driver . But the driver 's wife kept her nerve , got out her camera and photographed him . The man has been charged with dangerous driving , coercion and threatening behaviour . B-MISC prosecutors file sex tourism charges . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against two B-MISC men for sexually abusing children in B-LOC and distributing pornographic films and pictures of their degrading acts . The case is one of only a handful in which authorities have managed to track down suspects under a law which lets them pursue B-MISC who commit sex offences abroad . The pair , identified only as 43-year-old clerk B-PER I-PER and businessman B-PER I-PER , 33 , are alleged to have carried out acts of sexual indecency with children as young as 10 years old between 1994 and 1995 . Their videos included pictures of one of the accused tying up a B-MISC boy and performing acts of sadistic torture on him , prosecutors said in a statement . In another scene , a young girl performed oral sex with an unidentified adult man . The new law was introduced with much fanfare in 1993 . But prosecutors face huge difficulties in gathering evidence and bringing witnesses to testify in a B-MISC court , and only one person has so far been convicted under the law . Investigators are probing several other cases . The B-LOC prosecutors said they had been alerted to the two men by customs officials who intercepted packages containing pornographic photographs and order forms .

B-ORG I-ORG said other even more explicit photos were taken but it did not print them . The magazines named the woman as B-PER I-PER , a 26-year-old B-MISC singer and dancer in a B-MISC cabaret club . The photographs , an B-MISC exclusive , raised eyebrows in the tiny principality , where B-PER 's father B-PER I-PER , had long disapproved of his daughter 's choice of husband . B-PER had two children with B-PER before their marriage in July last year . B-PER , B-PER and B-PER are the children of B-PER and former B-LOC screen goddess B-PER I-PER , who was killed in a car crash in 1982 . " We have seen the photos but for the moment the palace has no comment , " a spokeswoman for B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . The magazines said the photographs were taken in B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC , some 15 km ( nine miles ) from B-LOC I-LOC . B-ORG said B-PER , a keen racing driver , met B-PER during a race in B-LOC and photographers had been on their trail ever since .

A single firework after midday signalled the start of the fruit-throwing frenzy , during which participants hurl some 100 tonnes of tomatoes trucked in for the occasion . Local historians say the tradition began in 1945 when disgruntled locals began spontaneously to bombard the priest and mayor at the annual fiesta in B-LOC ( pronounced B-LOC ) .

B-ORG earlier said its net profit for the six months to June 30 rose to 9.77 million pounds from 6.93 million in the previous first half . The company did not declare an interim dividend as in the previous year .

" However , it certainly is a very pleasing result for the first six months , " he said . B-PER said most of the company 's half year earning stemmed from the sale of its 50 percent stake in B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG of B-LOC .

" I would like to inform you about my decision to break away from B-PER I-PER , B-PER I-PER , B-LOC I-LOC 's dictatorial group , " he said in a copy of the statement obtained by B-ORG . " We believe that our country will be reduced to nothing if the B-ORG people continue to fight against each other indefinitely .... For this reason we decided to break away from that dictatorial group and found a movement named ' B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ' , " he said .

B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC 's Finance Minister B-PER I-PER told a news conference on Wednesday that he believes that the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG 's ( B-ORG ) interest rate policy which is geared towards ensuring economic growth has not changed after the release of the central bank 's " tankan " survey . The B-ORG released the August tankan , its quarterly short-term corporate survey , in the morning and it showed business outlook had worsened . However , B-PER said it did not necessarily show a substantial worsening of the economy . " The question is what the B-ORG is going to do with its interest rate policy . The B-ORG governor has made it clear that the B-ORG 's policy is aimed at ensuring basis for economic recovery . I believe this policy has not changed , " he said . Asked if a supplementary budget for 1996/97 was needed to support the economy , B-PER said the tankan results would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget . " I do n't think we should immediately draw a conclusion that the economic recovery has come to a halt or that signs of a economic contraction have emerged , " B-PER said . " The economy is not recovering smoothly or at a fast pace . " B-PER said he would make a decision on the need for a supplementary budget after an announcement in mid-September of B-LOC 's gross domestic product for the April-June quarter . " I would like to see how the economy moved in the first half of 1996 , " he said . B-LOC says militant B-LOC must face war past . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC on Wednesday called on B-LOC to acknowledge its wartime past and put a stop to a tide of resurgent militarism to prevent similar atrocities in future . " Some B-MISC are still unrepentant about the atrocities committed by the B-MISC militarists during the war , " said a commentary in the official B-ORG I-ORG . " If they are still undecided whether the war B-LOC launched was aggressive in nature , it will be difficult to tell whether they will do the same again , " the newspaper said . B-LOC raised indignant protests after several B-MISC cabinet ministers visited a shrine dedicated to their country 's war dead on August 15 , the 51st anniversary of B-LOC 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC surrender . " Numerous B-MISC politicians have tried to whitewash their country 's war atrocities in recent years , " the commentary said . B-LOC estimates 35 million B-MISC were killed or wounded by invading B-MISC troops from 1931 to 1945 . " The B-MISC have never genuinely apologised for their wartime crimes , " the commentary said . B-MISC Prime Minister B-PER I-PER marked the August 15 anniversary by expressing " remorse " for foreign victims of B-LOC 's B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC atrocities . B-LOC coalition party leader plans to resign . B-LOC 1996-08-28 The leader of a junior partner in B-LOC 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion , party officials said on Wednesday . The officials said B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG President B-PER I-PER , finance minister until the beginning of this year , promised his resignation in a meeting with the politician who set off the rebellion in the smallest coalition member . They said the date of B-PER 's resignation would be determined by party officials . The B-ORG row has caused jitters in its coalition partners , Prime Minister B-PER I-PER 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , the biggest grouping , and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if B-ORG splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election . The dispute pits B-PER , who founded B-ORG in 1993 as a reform-oriented B-ORG splinter group , against party official B-PER I-PER , who says he will leave B-ORG to form a reformist political group next month . B-PER , the 49-year-old grandson of a 1950s prime minister , on Tuesday quit as B-ORG secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 62-year-old B-PER , pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force . Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of B-PER , seen by B-PER backers as tainted by his senior role in the B-MISC coalition . The presence of B-PER , whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer , has stalled B-PER 's efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp , analysts said . Media reports say that at most 10 of 23 B-ORG members , joined by a handful of B-MISC I-MISC , will follow B-PER when he bolts -- far short of the 50 lawmakers needed to topple B-PER 's eight-month-old government . B-PER -- who returns from a 10-day B-MISC I-MISC tour on Saturday -- must call polls by mid-1997 , and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election . But many analysts and politicians believe he may dissolve parliament soon after it reconvenes in early October . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG interim net up 2.7 pct .

She gave no further details . B-LOC in 1937 in the central province of B-LOC , B-PER came to B-LOC as a student and remained in the city as a prolific author and teacher of B-MISC . She was divorced and lived alone , leaving one daughter who received university education in B-LOC and lives in B-LOC , a friend said . B-PER 's most famous book , " B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC " ( B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC ) , was translated into B-MISC and B-MISC , he said . B-PER I-PER plunges on rights issue , earnings .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 With 307 days to go before the B-MISC colony reverts to B-LOC , the B-LOC I-LOC media focused mainly on domestic issues concerning alleged pressure on a judge , cross straights relations and the democratic lobby 's relationship with B-LOC . The B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said B-LOC 's government could not hope to stem the island 's economic and trade exchanges with B-LOC . The paper said that using administrative power to limit economic activities across the B-LOC strait would not work . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said it hoped B-MISC officials would soon open dialogue with B-LOC I-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG and the newly-established democracy lobby , B-ORG , in order to ease anxieties in the lead-up to the handover . The B-MISC language B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said the judiciary needed to take swift and decisive action in investigating the allegations that a judge had been subjected to pressure in a B-LOC I-LOC immigration case involving allegations of fraud . The independence of the judiciary and the rule of law were of paramount importance to B-LOC I-LOC 's survival as a business centre . The B-MISC language daily B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said the B-ORG I-ORG had been indecisive in its handling of the judge 's case .

B-PER I-PER , director of the B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said he was freed on Tuesday without being charged . B-MISC Attorney-General B-PER I-PER was not immediately available to comment .

B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC has asked B-LOC to extradite its former president B-PER I-PER for alleged hijacking , an B-MISC embassy spokesman said on Wednesday . B-PER angered B-LOC last week by accusing top B-MISC leaders of ordering the assassination of B-MISC I-MISC leaders in a B-LOC restaurant in 1992 . He made the allegations at the trial of an B-MISC and four B-MISC accused of carrying out the attack . An B-MISC embassy spokesman said in response to an inquiry that B-LOC had formally requested B-PER 's extradition for hijacking the military aircraft which he commandeered to flee B-LOC in July 1981 . " We submitted the request three or four days ago , " he said . B-MISC authorities could not immediately be reached for comment . B-PER lives under round-the-clock security in B-LOC , fearing B-LOC could make an attempt on his life . He is due back in B-LOC on September 5 to continue his testimony , which has backed up B-MISC prosecutors ' allegations that B-LOC ordered the attack on the exiled leaders . Three dissidents and their translator were killed in the gangland-style machinegun attack . B-LOC has warned B-LOC that bilateral relations could suffer if it pays heed to the testimony of B-PER , an architect of B-LOC 's B-MISC revolution who has been a sworn enemy of B-LOC since he fell from favour after a year as president . B-ORG military chiefs to visit B-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-28 Top military officials from B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG countries will tour B-LOC and B-LOC next month for their annual inspection of alliance country installations and forces . B-ORG said in a statement received on Wednesday that its military committee would visit the two countries between September 8 and 13 . The committee consists of the chiefs of defence staff of each alliance country except B-LOC , which has no armed forces . B-ORG 's top military men -- General B-PER I-PER , Supreme Allied Commander B-LOC , and General B-PER I-PER , Supreme Allied Commander B-LOC -- will also attend . The committee 's last tour was in September 1995 in B-LOC , B-LOC and the B-LOC . B-PER B-ORG says agreed sale of B-LOC unit . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC cleaning group B-ORG on Wednesday said it had signed a letter of intent to sell its troubled B-LOC unit B-ORG I-ORG to B-MISC firm B-ORG I-ORG . An B-ORG statement said that B-ORG , with year-end 1996 assets of B-MISC 10.9 million and equity of $ 10.5 million , would be listed on the B-LOC stock exchange , but did not say when . It said that under the sale agreement , full financial details of which were not revealed , B-ORG would acquire a 25 percent stake in B-ORG which would become an associated company within the B-ORG group trading under the B-ORG name and logo . B-ORG I-ORG senior management would continue to run the business under the new owners , it said . B-MISC analysts recently estimated B-ORG I-ORG 's sale value at up to $ 118 million . B-ORG said that the deal included B-ORG I-ORG operations in B-LOC and the sale of B-ORG I-ORG interests in B-LOC would be discussed . On August 15 , B-ORG published first half 1996 results showing a two billion crown loss caused by falsified accounts in B-ORG I-ORG and said that charges and provisions earlier estimated at $ 100 million would have to be increased to $ 146 million . It also wrote down all B-ORG I-ORG goodwill and Wednesday 's statement said that the B-ORG purchase would not necessitate further write down if the sale were completed according to the terms of the letter of intent . -- B-PER I-PER , B-LOC newsroom +45 33969650 B-LOC balks at B-ORG staff for oil-for-food deal . B-PER I-PER B-ORG I-ORG 1996-08-28 B-LOC has balked at the number of B-ORG staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal , blaming the B-LOC I-LOC for insisting on stringent monitoring . In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday , B-MISC diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff , which B-LOC has to finance , surpasses funds allocated for electricity , water , sewers , education and agriculture . At issue was a May 20 agreement allowing B-LOC to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food , medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded B-LOC in August 1990 . The B-MISC statement said the B-LOC I-LOC was " interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified . " B-LOC 's deputy ambassador , B-PER I-PER , noted that the May 20 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the B-ORG I-ORG and that the government of B-LOC would be consulted . B-PER in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the B-ORG officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General B-PER I-PER reports that arrangements are in place . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , which has to coordinate the distribution of food , medicine and other goods , increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the B-LOC I-LOC . According to B-ORG officials and diplomats , B-LOC would have about $ 1.13 billion to spend for food , medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for B-MISC I-MISC victims and costs for B-ORG weapons inspections were deducted . The cost of the B-ORG staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $ 31 million . In addition another $ 12 million was anticipated to cover other expenses , such as oil experts and administrative costs . For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the B-ORG I-ORG estimated it needed 1,190 people , including 267 international staff and 923 B-MISC support staff . Of this number 64 foreign and 598 local staff would be in the northern B-MISC provinces , no longer the direct control of the B-LOC government . Another 203 international staff and 325 B-MISC would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country . There are also 14 monitors to watch oil flows , 32 customs experts and four B-MISC I-MISC oil experts or overseers to approve contracts . B-PER I-PER , the B-ORG undersecretary-general , told the B-ORG I-ORG last week that the " financial requirements to support the ( humanitarian ) programme represent a very modest percentile of the total ... roughly 3 percent .

B-ORG I-ORG cool on changing beef cull plan . B-LOC 1996-08-29 The B-ORG I-ORG said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying B-LOC 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign . " Obviously we are interested in this research . We will ask the ( B-ORG ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , " B-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( B-MISC ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by B-LOC and its 14 B-ORG partners . " We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of B-MISC cases possible . I think it would be very difficult to sell to the B-ORG I-ORG a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer B-MISC cases , " B-PER said . " We will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , " he said . " We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that 's not the issue . The issue is the protection of consumers ' health and the rapid eradication of B-MISC , " he added . The reaction is likely to disappoint B-MISC farmers , who seized on research by B-ORG scientists in the scientific journal B-ORG saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle . The researchers predicted there would be 340 new infections and 14,000 new cases of B-MISC before 2001 . B-MISC farmers ' leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report . " I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue , " B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG president Sir B-PER I-PER told B-ORG I-ORG . B-PER said there was no need for B-LOC to carry out a planned cull of some 147,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its B-MISC partners . " The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout B-LOC accepted this evidence , " B-PER said . The report could well reopen a damaging row between B-LOC and the B-ORG , which slapped a worldwide ban on B-MISC beef after the government said there could be a link between B-MISC and the human form of the disease . The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with B-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) from eating B-MISC beef . B-MISC farmers set up blockades in mad cow protest . B-LOC 1996-08-29 Thousands of farmers threw up roadblocks across B-LOC overnight , stopping and checking lorries suspected of importing meat from outside the B-ORG I-ORG , B-MISC radios reported on Thursday . Radio stations said around 15,000 farmers , angered by a fall in beef prices following the mad cow disease crisis , staged protests in many areas and blockaded several main roads and motorways . By 3 a.m. ( 0100 B-MISC ) more than 2,000 lorries had been stopped and searched . B-MISC beef sales plunged after B-LOC announced the discovery of a likely link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( B-MISC ) , or mad cow disease , and its fatal human equivalent B-MISC I-MISC ( B-MISC ) .

B-PER , who was one of the few B-MISC to make a good impression in his test debut at B-LOC I-LOC last week , showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of B-LOC runs and then collected the wickets of B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER in a spell of 10-1-36-2 .

B-PER and B-PER I-PER then added 59 for the second wicket before B-LOC struck back with three wickets for 19 in the space of five overs . First , B-PER , after making 48 , was bowled by B-PER as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side . B-PER , who promoted himself to number four in the order , followed for six when B-PER drifted another well-flighted delivery behind his legs . Shortly after B-PER was also back in the pavilion for 48 after B-PER had repaid B-PER with another good catch at long-on .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-28 B-PER I-PER decided that when in B-LOC I-LOC , do as the B-MISC I-MISC do -- and the B-MISC 's new-found aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the B-MISC I-MISC . The fourth-seeded B-MISC , who is tackling the world class traffic of B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC as a warm-up by driving to the tennis centre for her matches , ran over B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER 6-1 6-3 on Wednesday to take her place in the third round . " I 've been trying my whole career to be aggressive , " said the 24-year-old B-PER after crushing B-PER in just over an hour . " What I 'm trying to do is be aggressive all the time , maybe go up to the net a few times like I did tonight . That would really help . " B-PER , the 1994 B-MISC champion , used to struggle at the B-MISC , but has come to terms with the noise , crowds and chaos . " There is a lot of things that can happen , " B-PER said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at B-LOC I-LOC . " Like traffic . We stay in B-LOC and it 's a long way to come . The crowds , they speak louder or they move . That does n't happen in other B-MISC I-MISC . That 's where the real champion wins . You have to concentrate for these two weeks . " It took B-PER four Opens to get as far as the quarters , and another four to match that . Last year , B-PER , who finished 1995 ranked second in the world , reached the semifinals before bowing out to B-PER I-PER . Now she feels she is in the swing of things . " I have my own car now and that helps , " said B-PER . " Sometimes the transportation they ( the tournament ) provide gets a little messed up . This time it did n't happen . I do the driving and I love it . It gets my adrenalin going , those taxi drivers . " We change lanes all the time in B-LOC . I 'm used to it and I like to drive fast . " BASEBALL - B-ORG SIGN B-PER . B-LOC 1996-08-28 The defending world champion B-ORG I-ORG , with the best record and best pitching in baseball , added another weapon Wednesday , acquiring B-PER I-PER , the winningest left-hander in the B-MISC I-MISC , from the B-ORG I-ORG . The B-ORG , who conceded earlier this week they would be forced to trim salary from next season 's payroll , received B-PER I-PER , a first baseman at Double-A B-ORG ; B-PER I-PER , a pitcher at Class-A B-ORG , and a player to be named . It was another stunning mid-season acquisition for the B-ORG , who already have an 11-game lead in the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC . In the last 15 days , B-LOC has traded for third baseman B-PER I-PER , claimed outfielder B-PER I-PER on waivers and called up minor-league phenom B-PER I-PER , all in preparation for their fifth post-season .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-MISC champions B-PER I-PER and B-PER I-PER and former champion B-PER I-PER will run in a " B-ORG I-ORG " sprint relay squad in honour of B-PER I-PER on Friday . B-PER , the 200 metres world record holder , and B-LOC 's 1992 B-MISC 100 champion B-PER confirmed on Thursday that they would join 100 record holder B-PER and B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER in one of the greatest 4x100 squads ever assembled . They will run against quartets from the B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC in a special race at the B-LOC B-MISC I-MISC meeting to mark the 60th anniversary of B-PER 's four gold medals at the 1936 B-MISC in the B-MISC capital . B-PER will run the anchor leg after B-LOC 's B-PER , B-MISC B-PER and B-MISC silver medallist B-PER have run the first three stages of the relay . The participation of B-PER and B-PER had been known before Thursday . But B-PER did not announce his decision to run until the eve of the meeting when organisers also confirmed B-PER would take part . B-PER is due to retire from international competition at the end of the season although he may compete for B-LOC in next season 's B-MISC I-MISC . Although B-PER , who is not racing the individual 100 metres in B-LOC , took his time to agree to run , the veteran was clearly delighted to be part of the tribute to the black B-MISC . When five former B-MISC 100 champions from 1948 to 1980 , who have been invited to watch the race , turned up at a news conference on Thursday , B-PER was quick to put his autograph book in front of the them . " I do n't normally do this but can you please sign , " he said thrusting an ornate white book in front of B-MISC B-PER I-PER ( 1948 ) , B-PER I-PER ( 1952 ) , B-PER I-PER ( 1968 ) , B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER ( 1976 ) and B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER ( 1980 ) . " B-PER I-PER inspired everyone here and it is great to have a tribute to him . " B-PER 's widow B-PER is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out by the sprinter 's grand-daughter B-PER I-PER during the meeting B-LOC organisers hoped to have B-MISC 1984 and 1988 champion B-PER I-PER in the squad but he injured himself in last Friday 's B-LOC meeting . SOCCER - B-ORG AWARDED B-MISC I-MISC WIN . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-MISC soccer 's sports judge on Thursday ruled that B-ORG , beaten 3-0 by B-ORG in the first round of the B-MISC I-MISC , should be awarded a 2-0 victory because their opponents fielded a banned player . The ruling meant that serie B club B-ORG now meet local B-MISC I-MISC arch-rivals B-ORG in the second round . B-ORG appealed after their defeat last Saturday on the grounds that B-ORG striker B-PER I-PER , who came on in the 71st minute with his team leading 2-0 , still had a one-match suspension to serve from last season . SOCCER - B-ORG SACK COACH B-PER . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-29 Struggling B-MISC first division side B-ORG on Thursday announced they were parting with coach B-PER I-PER after a string of poor results .

B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-LOC joined the B-LOC I-LOC on Thursday in welcoming B-LOC and B-LOC 's agreement on the text of a much-delayed friendship treaty , which it said would contribute to stability in the area . " The B-LOC I-LOC believes that such a treaty will contribute positively to the further development of good neighbourly relations between the two countries and enhance the stability of the region , " said the B-MISC Foreign office statement . The accord , agreed two weeks ago , is expected to end years of disputes over the status of B-LOC 's large ethnic B-MISC minority . It will also boost both countries ' ambitions to join B-ORG and the B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC and B-LOC say the treaty should be signed in the first half of September . " The B-LOC I-LOC looks forward to the early signature of the treaty , " the statement said . B-LOC B-MISC IN B-LOC CLOSED ON B-MISC I-MISC , SEP 2 .

B-ORG I-ORG newspaper said B-PER was not named in the divorce petition heard by a court in B-LOC , southern B-LOC . But B-PER I-PER , a television presenter , is said to have blamed B-PER for the problems in her marriage and she has repeatedly mocked the princess on her breakfast television programme .

B-LOC 1996-08-29 A total of 116 delegates to B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) were formally installed on Thursday , launching another phase of the B-MISC I-MISC nation 's much-delayed democratic transition . The 116 , representing political parties in the capital B-LOC , will help organise a voter census , a constitutional referendum planned for January and efforts to brief potential voters on what balloting involves . A total of 9,446 delegates will be deployed throughout B-LOC 's 11 provinces for the elections , which must be held by July 1997 under the transitional constitution . Presidential , parliamentary and municipal elections are planned for May . " We can meet the required deadlines for organising the elections . All that is needed is for everyone to show goodwill , " B-ORG spokesman B-PER I-PER I-PER told reporters . Delegates to the commission from the other 10 provinces will be installed progressively from next week with the provinces of B-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC having priority , he said . The installation of delegates was initially scheduled for July . Officials said lack of funding had delayed the process . President B-PER I-PER I-PER , who seized power in a 1965 coup , introduced a multi-party system in 1990 but B-LOC 's transition has lagged well behind that of other states in the region . In the past , B-PER has been elected without opposition . B-LOC would not refuse B-ORG officials . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-LOC would not object to a visit by B-ORG officials but insists its suspension from the organisation be resolved before any other questions are addressed , Foreign Minister B-PER I-PER said on Thursday . B-PER reiterated his position that the B-ORG had no mandate to send a fact-finding mission . " The request I have received is for their officials to come and talk to my officials . We cannot object to people wanting to visit B-LOC , " B-PER told B-ORG by telephone from the capital B-LOC . " The fundamental problem we have with the B-ORG is our unfair suspension . Any discussions we have at ministerial level will be a continuation of what we began in B-LOC on that . Before that is accomplished we cannot address anything else . " B-LOC was suspended from the B-ORG in November after the execution of B-PER I-PER and eight other minority rights activists in defiance of international pleas for clemency . A meeting of B-ORG ministers in B-LOC on Wednesday said it planned to send a team of senior officials to B-LOC as soon as possible to persuade B-LOC to accept a fact-finding mission . The timing of that mission has yet to be determined . The latest diplomatic row between B-LOC 's military government and the club of B-LOC and its former colonies erupted over the terms of a visit by B-ORG ministers to discuss B-LOC 's suspension . B-LOC said they would be restricted to a two-day meeting with government officials , but the B-ORG said it wanted to hold meetings with people outside the government and called off the visit . B-MISC Queen B-PER to visit B-LOC I-LOC in October . B-LOC 1996-08-29 Queen B-PER of B-LOC I-LOC will pay a four-day state visit to B-LOC I-LOC in October , the first by a ruling B-MISC monarch , the B-MISC I-MISC foreign ministry said on Thursday .

The queen will be accompanied by her husband Prince B-PER on the September 30 to October 3 visit . B-LOC bans guns ahead of local elections . B-LOC 1996-08-29 With tension rising among B-LOC 's political parties ahead of local elections on November 24 , the B-ORG I-ORG on Thursday banned the carrying of guns and ammunition until the end of the year . " It is forbidden for holders of permits for weapons of all categories to transport the said arms and their ammunition outside their homes , " the statement said .

B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-ORG forces released a group of B-MISC I-MISC policemen late on Thursday and a tense confrontation appeared to be easing , an alliance spokesman said . " The situation in B-LOC seems to be very much on its way toward resolution . My understanding is the ( B-MISC ) police have been released ... In B-LOC , we think the situation is winding down as well , " B-ORG spokesman Lieutenant Colonel B-PER I-PER told B-ORG . B-ORG troops detained 65 B-MISC I-MISC policemen early on Thursday after they attacked B-MISC refugees returning to homes in B-LOC , a B-MISC village on B-LOC 's internal boundary line . In apparent retaliation for B-ORG 's detention of the B-MISC , an angry B-MISC mob including policemen trapped six unarmed B-ORG police monitors and three local aides in their office in the town of B-LOC , east of B-LOC . B-PER said B-ORG forces confiscated 25 long-barreled B-MISC automatic assault rifles from the detained B-MISC before setting them free . " Local radio and television there ( in B-LOC ) are advising people to step back and take it easy . We think that when the word about how things are going in B-LOC which is about 35 minutes away by road reaches B-LOC that should help , " B-PER said . Storm kills 11 at B-MISC religious festival . B-LOC 1996-08-29 At least 11 people were killed and 60 others injured on Thursday when lightning struck a group of people attending a religious festival in B-LOC , police and municipal officials said .

B-PER , B-PER discuss election crisis . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-LOC envoy B-PER I-PER met B-MISC President B-PER I-PER on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding B-LOC 's post-war elections . The B-MISC diplomat arrived in B-LOC two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in B-LOC due to irregularities in the registration of B-MISC refugee voters . " We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the B-LOC I-LOC ( B-MISC I-MISC republic ) which led to this development , " B-PER said after three hours of talks . But he said the B-LOC I-LOC still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in B-LOC as scheduled on September 14 to bolster the peace process . B-PER gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from B-PER , the patron of the B-MISC I-MISC , to rectify any abuses in the registration process . B-LOC 's B-MISC political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved . Human rights workers say B-MISC and B-MISC I-MISC authorities coerced refugees to register only in B-MISC territory in B-LOC to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest . B-MISC officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 10-day registration period and the B-MISC I-MISC , angry at the postponement of municipal elections , have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community 's blessing . B-PER said only elections endorsed by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) would be legitimate . " As we have said publicly before , if there is any effort to do so ( hold local elections ) these elections will not be valid , " he said . " The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the B-ORG . " After meeting B-PER , B-PER flew to the B-MISC capital B-LOC . He was due to head to the B-MISC town of B-LOC I-LOC on Friday to meet B-MISC I-MISC acting president B-PER I-PER and B-MISC I-MISC opposition leaders . He also planned to travel to B-LOC to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist B-MISC mini-state in western B-LOC .

[ CORRECTED 05:53 B-MISC ] B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-28 Pre-electoral bickering flared on Wednesday in the troubled western B-MISC state of B-LOC as some opposition politicians demanded the army pull out of the area ahead of an upcoming state poll . The mayor of B-LOC , a small town some 310 miles ( 500 km ) south of B-LOC I-LOC , sent a letter to B-LOC 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG complaining the army 's heavy presence in the town would interfere with the Oct. 6 election . B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER , of the opposition B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , said in Wednesday 's letter that army troops recently raided several local farms , stole cattle and raped women . The letter was signed by some 200 area residents and indigenous leaders . Some electoral watchdog groups also said the presence of the army , which has fanned out across the state in the past month in search of a new guerrilla group , was likely to intimidate voters and had stirred up tension in the state . A B-MISC group of electoral observers , B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , concluded the army presence exerted a heavy psychological pressure on local farmers and would prevent a fair vote . Up for grabs in the election are the state legislature and 75 town halls . ( Corrects to show elections are not for governor ) . Despite the criticism , acting state Gov . B-PER I-PER pledged the elections will be free and fair and said he did not expect any trouble from the elusive new guerrilla group , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " The electoral process has been proceeding in accordance with the new state electoral law , " B-PER said , adding that the poll would be " an exercise in true democracy . " B-LOC police arrest wanted B-MISC man - report . B-PER I-PER , B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-MISC authorities on Wednesday arrested a 47-year-old B-MISC man wanted in B-LOC for ties to the leftist B-ORG I-ORG guerrilla group of the 1970s , local television said . B-ORG I-ORG said the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ordered the arrest of B-PER I-PER , a political scientist who owns two B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC restaurants , based on an extradition request from the B-MISC government . The report , which could not be independently verified on Wednesday night , said B-PER was sentenced in B-LOC to eight years and 11 months in prison for robbery and illegal weapons and explosives possession . B-ORG quoted B-PER 's lawyer as saying he had already been imprisoned in B-LOC and , when freed , travelled to B-LOC . Seven churches slam B-LOC rural violence , impunity . B-LOC 1996-08-28 Seven churches joined voices on Wednesday to condemn the " day-to-day violence " of B-LOC 's rural hinterland and the government 's failure to punish those responsible for massacres of landless peasants . " In the name of B-PER , we want to bring your attention to what is going on in the B-MISC countryside , " two church umbrella groups said in a Letter to the B-MISC People . The letter from B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG was sent to President B-PER I-PER I-PER after a seminar on endemic violence gripping rural B-LOC . Thirty-six people have died so far this year in conflicts over land in the B-MISC countryside , including 19 landless peasants massacred by police in April in the northern state of B-LOC . " The problem of land is one of the most serious facing B-LOC , " said B-PER I-PER I-PER , president of the B-MISC church 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . The letter made reference to massacres of landless peasants in August 1995 and April 1996 , which claimed the lives of 27 landless peasants . B-MISC official flees B-LOC I-LOC after passport scam . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-29 A B-MISC consular official has fled B-LOC I-LOC after being questioned by anti-corruption police in connection with soliciting bribes to issue a passport , B-LOC I-LOC government radio said on Thursday . The unnamed suspect left the B-MISC colony after being detained and then freed by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) , the radio said . The man was released after his arrest on Tuesday , pending further inquiries , the B-ORG said in a statement . The anti-graft body was discussing the case with the B-MISC government , especially the suspect 's status , it said . It is not clear if the fugitive had diplomatic status in B-LOC I-LOC , and officials from the B-MISC Consulate were not available for comment . The arrest came after the B-ORG received a complaint that the man had demanded a bribe of B-MISC 100,000 ( B-MISC 12,940 ) to issue a B-MISC passport , the B-ORG said . At the time of his arrest , B-ORG officers seized B-MISC 100,000 , it added . The B-ORG has kept a close eye on passport scams after a B-LOC official was jailed for trafficking fake B-MISC passports as part of an immigration racket aimed at B-MISC . B-MISC poll shows military wants PM B-PER out . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-LOC 's powerful military thinks the government is dishonest and Prime Minister B-PER I-PER 's resignation might solve the nation 's political and economic woes , an opinion poll showed on Thursday . Nearly half the 1,617 military personnel surveyed in the B-ORG I-ORG poll suggested that B-PER resign , while about 28 percent thought he should dissolve parliament and 24 percent thought a cabinet reshuffle could resolve the government 's problems . B-PER , who leads a six-party , 13-month-old coalition government , faces a no-confidence debate in parliament next month . The prime minister , who has already lost one coalition partner this month , is expected to have a tough battle in the debate because of infighting in his own party and warnings of more pullouts by other coalition partners . The poll , conducted earlier this month after B-PER 's coalition completed one year in office , showed the military would prefer General B-PER I-PER -- a former prime minister who was ousted in a military coup in February 1991 -- as prime minister . Defence Minister B-PER I-PER , head of coalition member the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , was the second choice for prime minister , the poll showed . B-PER came in last on the list of proposed leaders with less than one percent of the votes . Nearly two-thirds of the people surveyed thought the government was dishonest and insincere , and 65 percent blamed the government 's poor performance for the country 's economic slowdown . The opinion of the military in B-LOC , which has seen 17 coups or attempted coups since the country switched to parliamentary democracy from absolute monarchy in 1932 , always carries weight in the political scene , despite officials ' vows to distance the military from politics . B-ORG cleric jailed in B-LOC hospitalised briefly . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-MISC prison officials took jailed B-MISC militant B-ORG founder Sheikh B-PER I-PER to hospital briefly on Thursday for medical tests , officials said . " This evening Sheikh B-PER completed medical checks and returned to B-LOC prisons authority medical centre , " said a spokesman for B-LOC 's internal security ministry . A prison official said B-PER had a mild case of pneumonia . The 60-year-old B-MISC cleric , jailed by B-LOC since 1989 , is serving a life sentence for ordering attacks by B-ORG guerrillas against B-MISC targets . The ailing B-PER is the spiritual leader of the fundamentalist B-ORG group which has killed scores of B-MISC in suicide attacks aimed at wrecking B-MISC peace deals . B-MISC President B-PER I-PER has demanded that B-LOC release B-PER -- who is confined to a wheelchair -- on humanitarian grounds . B-LOC said last month after it recovered the body of a soldier abducted by B-ORG seven years ago that it would consider freeing B-PER . B-MISC King meets former B-LOC PM B-PER . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-PER I-PER of B-LOC met former B-MISC prime minister B-PER I-PER on Thursday at the coastal resort of B-LOC , 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of B-LOC , an official source said . " Mr B-PER I-PER , who is on a purely private and family visit to B-LOC , was received on Thursday by his Majesty B-PER I-PER at the royal palace of B-LOC , " the source said . Accompanied by his wife and grandson , B-PER arrived in B-LOC on August 25 . B-PER is expected to fly home on Friday , officials said . Scandal hits B-PER campaign at vital moment . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-29 President B-PER I-PER 's triumphal appearance at the B-MISC convention , a vital moment in his bid for a second term , was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal . B-PER was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his 10-week re-election campaign when political strategist B-PER I-PER abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday . The tabloid B-ORG I-ORG reported the married B-PER had a lengthy affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with B-PER , and with whom he shared B-LOC I-LOC speeches before they were made . " B-PER I-PER is my friend , and he is a superb political strategist , " B-PER said in a written statement . " I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years . " B-PER declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue . The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some B-MISC , who had planned a triumphal celebration of B-PER 's lead over B-PER in the opinion polls . Senator B-PER I-PER , a B-LOC B-MISC , called it a " big bump " in the way of the B-PER campaign . " It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president , " B-PER said . B-PER was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the B-MISC I-MISC opening at 8 p.m. EDT ( midnight B-MISC ) . The 50-year-old president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing , sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers . B-MISC hope to seize on the " character " issue to bolster B-PER 's challenger B-PER I-PER in the final weeks of the campaign . Speaking in B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC , B-PER did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of B-PER , who had advised B-PER to chart a more centrist political course , would make B-PER drift back to the left . " B-PER has been trying to make President B-PER a B-MISC , now maybe he 'll revert to the liberal B-MISC that he really is , " B-PER told reporters . B-PER will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first B-MISC incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of B-PER I-PER I-PER . Aides said B-PER planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles ( km ) from the convention hall working on his speech . It was apparently neglected on his long " whistle-stop " train trip to the convention , during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country 's heartland . He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest . But first lady B-PER I-PER I-PER told B-ORG television , " He 's really fired up . " " He wants to outline to the B-MISC people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years , and what he would like to see done in the next four years , " she said . " He 's very excited about this convention ... He 's excited about the campaign . But more than that , he 's very resolute about what he wants to do . " " I do n't take anything for granted . I always expect elections to get close . I expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then , " she said of the November 5 election date . B-PER is leading B-PER by as much as 15 points according to some polls . The campaign pits B-PER , a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service , but stilted speaking style , against the glib and confident B-PER , who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience . B-LOC weekly muni bond indices - B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-29 The following B-LOC tax-exempt municipal bond indices were compiled by B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG for the week ending August 30 .

B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG researchers on Thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals . Word of the findings , to be published in the Oct. 1 issue of the journal " B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , " came in advance of the annual B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research . Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials . Nevertheless , " a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , " the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG Medical Centre said in a release . Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat . Death strikes in early adulthood . Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin . In the study at the University 's B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene . The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes . In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing . Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said . The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .

B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-29 The help-wanted advertising index fell in July , the B-ORG I-ORG said Thursday , reflecting the uneven nature of the nation 's labour markets . The monthly index fell to 83.0 in July against a reading of 85.0 in June , the private business research group said . In July , the volume of help-wanted advertising fell in five of the nine B-LOC regions . " The labour market has been expanding throughout 1996 , but in a very uneven pattern , " B-ORG I-ORG economist B-PER I-PER said . " Recent want-ad figures indicate that conservative hiring plans are keeping job growth below the rate of overall economic activity . " With 2.5 percent gross domestic product growth expected for 1996 , new job growth should slowly lower the unemployment rate over the rest of the year . " With the unemployment rate staying close to about 5.5 percent over the last two years , there is a good chance the rate will slowly drop to about 5.0 percent by the end of the year , " B-PER said . The July index matched the reading for July , 1995 . The greatest declines in the volume of help-wanted advertising were in the B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC regions . The greatest increase was in the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC region . Police seek suspects in B-LOC I-LOC jewel heist . B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-LOC I-LOC police said Thursday they were seeking two men and two women in connection with a $ 690,000 theft of jewelry and cash from a guest of the Showboat Hotel and Casino . Capt . B-PER I-PER said police were seeking a man shown on a hotel videotape carrying a suitcase resembling the victim 's . " We want to talk to him , " B-PER said of the man . A second man and two women also were being sought . The thefts occurred Sunday when the victim , B-LOC I-LOC jewelry wholesaler B-PER I-PER , left three suitcases in a closet at B-ORG I-ORG in the hotel while he checked out . While he was gone , two women in their mid-twenties and an older man entered the jewelry store and tried to distract store owner B-PER I-PER . When B-PER returned two of the suitcases were missing . They contained $ 650,000 in jewelry and $ 40,000 in cash , B-PER said . He said the man on the videotape did not match the description given by the jewelry store owner . B-PER I-PER hints at more supporting evidence . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-PER I-PER said on Thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month . The former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last October of the murders of his former wife , B-PER I-PER I-PER , and her friend , B-PER I-PER , in June 1994 . He now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths . He told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers . But he added without elaborating , " hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial . " The judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers , witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public . " I would love to speak about everything , " said B-PER , who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward . His lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts Sept . 17 will be that he did not kill the victims . B-PER said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book . He added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home . " I 'm broke . I am not crying the blues . I can get along just fine , " he said . " Whatever you want to send me , I need . " He again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on Wednesday in an address at a jam-packed B-LOC church . Contrary to news reports , B-PER said , he has received support from both blacks and whites . He again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career , only to seek their support after he faced murder charges . A crowd of 2,000 paid $ 10 a head to hear the former star running back for the B-ORG I-ORG professional football club and a B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC member on Wednesday night .

In a written statement , distributed by the B-PER campaign , B-PER avoided comment on published allegations that he had engaged in a year-long affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute . The statement from B-PER said that he had submitted his resignation on Wednesday night . " While I served I sought to avoid the limelight because I did not want to become the message . Now , I resign so I will not become the issue , " he said . The announcement followed a report in the weekly supermarket tabloid B-ORG I-ORG , reprinted in Thursday 's editions of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , that the married adviser had hired a 37-year-old prostitute on a weekly basis while visiting B-LOC to advise B-PER on his re-election campaign . " I will not subject my wife , family or friends to the sadistic , vitriol of yellow journalism . I will not dignify such journalism with a reply or an answer . I never will , " his statement said . It was distributed to reporters at the press centre of B-PER 's B-MISC convention headquarters just hours before the president was to address the delegates accepting the party 's nomination for a second four-year term in the B-LOC I-LOC . B-LOC surgeon investigated for discarding foot . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-29 Health officials said on Thursday they were investigating the discovery of an amputated foot on a beach near B-LOC to determine whether a local surgeon had improperly disposed of infectious waste . The foot , which washed up on B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC beach this month , was amputated three years ago from a child whose legs were deformed . The foot had to be removed so the infant could be fitted with a prosthesis . An orthopedic surgeon was given permission by the child 's parents and the hospital to keep the foot for research and educational purposes . Health officials said the surgeon told authorities he stored the foot in his freezer at home , but the freezer recently broke down and the contents spoiled . The surgeon , who apologised for the incident , said he decided to put the foot in a crab trap to remove the flesh . The foot later washed up on the beach . B-LOC cop disguised as shrub nabs bad guys . B-LOC 1996-08-29 It was a bush that bagged the bad guys . When four would-be robbers , armed and masked , showed up to rob a B-ORG I-ORG restaurant in the B-LOC I-LOC suburb of B-LOC I-LOC on Tuesday , they had no idea the shrub near the drive-through window was toting a shotgun . Detective B-PER I-PER , camouflaged as a shaggy green bush , ordered them to freeze . " They were quite surprised , " he told the B-ORG I-ORG . B-PER said he made the hot , heavy suit , which he first used in the B-ORG , by attaching strips of burlap to a camouflage outfit . B-PER and black face paint completed his disguise . He was staking out the restaurant after a series of robberies at local fast-food places . B-LOC I-LOC police said five people were arrested as a result of the 90-minute stakeout , including the four robbers and a restaurant employee who was allegedly prepared to let them in a back door .

The B-ORG 's cereals management committee sold 234,324 tonnes of B-MISC intervention barley at a minimum price of 105.07 B-MISC per tonne . B-LOC I-LOC provisionally bought 800,000 tonnes of optional-origin barley at an August 21 tender at prices between $ 160 and $ 162 including cost , insurance and freight , traders said last week . But B-MISC grain traders and officials said the B-MISC might reduce the purchase to 600,000 tonnes . Traders have said a substantial part of the deal was likely to come from the B-ORG I-ORG , which enjoys a supply and freight advantage over other producers . But subtracting freight costs , the equivalent fob price of the deal is around $ 142 , well below the $ 149 per tonne floor price which the B-ORG put on its barley as news of the deal emerged last week . Last Thursday the B-ORG sold 34,277 tonnes of B-MISC intervention barley at a minimum price of 109.36 B-MISC per tonne , which was seen as worth $ 149 per tonne fob . -- B-LOC newsroom +331 4221 5432 B-MISC shipyard workers march against job cuts .

B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG jumped 23 percent Thursday on the expectation the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business . The B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC , company was up 2-1/8 at 11-3/8 after its announcement Wednesday that it planned to pull out of the highly competitive modem-chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment . " Certainly the company will be a much smaller company now , but it will be a more profitable business , " said analyst B-PER I-PER of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . But analysts noted that B-ORG still has much painful work ahead of it , including cutting as many as 150 jobs from its workforce , which currently has 500 people , and building up the business of its B-ORG unit , which makes routing devices and chipsets for high-speed computer networks . The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $ 50 million to $ 80 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments . B-PER I-PER of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modem-chip business . " Once you announce your intention to exit a business , it becomes a complete buyer 's market , " he said . And he said that while the company is focusing on the fastest-growing part of its business , the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of much-larger players such as B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " As the market develops the question is , are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company ? " B-PER said . Other analysts were more bullish , even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales . " It 's a positive strategic move , " said B-PER I-PER of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " The modem business is a low-margin , commodity business , " he said . The company 's B-ORG unit generated $ 33 million of the company 's $ 117 million in sales in the first half of the year , compared with $ 45 million in sales of modem chips , B-PER said . But the B-ORG unit is far more profitable , he said . B-ORG 's stock has fallen from a high of nearly $ 25 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand . -- B-LOC bureau 206-386-4848 B-ORG shares sink after profit warning .

B-PER flew by helicopter to B-MISC B-LOC and after a brief arrival ceremony went into talks with B-PER . The prime minister 's visit , his first trip outside the country since B-LOC was shaken by food riots earlier this month , came against the backdrop of a B-MISC general strike in the B-LOC I-LOC and B-LOC . B-PER called the four-hour strike , which ended at noon ( 0900 B-MISC ) to protest against B-MISC policy on settlements and B-LOC .

B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-LOC will continue to hold the key to the middle distillates product market in the B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC in the short term , traders in the region said on Thursday . They said premiums on high quality jet kerosene have widened to around $ 1 , and are likely to remain strong in the near term . " On the jet kerosene side we must be cautious about quality . Some are commanding a very good premium of 95 cents to one dollar . It 's been 99 cents to B-LOC . This will stay at this sort of price premium for a while , " one said . " But for normal jet the weakened demand is quite noticeable , the premium is around 45-50 cents . The differential is not normally as wide as this , " he added . Another put the premium for jet kerosene at between 65 and 75 cents . One trader said despite the fact that some kerosene was in storage at B-LOC ports , demand looked to exceed supply in the near term . Jet kerosene was assessed at $ 27.40 - $ 27.70 a barrel fob B-LOC on Thursday , up from $ 27.22 last week . Dealers expected premiums to stick around current levels for the next two or three weeks , before they get a boost in the second half of September from demand for October cargoes . Gas oil , assessed at $ 24.00 - $ 24.20 a barrel fob B-LOC , was little changed on Thursday from last week 's $ 24.10 - $ 24.24 .

" The B-MISC have awarded three cargoes , but the question is whether they will come out for more , " he added . B-LOC has acquired 120,000 tonnes of diesel in three cargoes , bound for the west coast , in its October tender . Traders said the award could be B-LOC 's lowest in recent years . " After B-ORG 's very small purchase of 120,000 tonnes , I 'm still suspicious that they will buy more in the second half of October , " another said . But traders see the market remaining tight in the short-term , with some surplus arising closer to October . " I see an overhang of gas oil further out , " one said . " Gas oil will remain tight in the short term up to mid-September with the premium of around $ 1 for 0.5 percent ( sulphur material ) . In the second half of September and October we see the premium coming off to 70-75 cents . " Traders said there was not much demand for one percent sulphur material gas oil , with the premium at 40 to 45 cents . B-LOC police catch ancient manuscript thieves .

A person walking on the shore at B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC found the debris and alerted police who forwarded it to B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC I-LOC , where the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and the B-ORG are conducting an investigation . The B-ORG jet exploded in a deadly fireball last month , killing 230 people , crashing in the B-LOC I-LOC at least 80 miles from where the debris was found Wednesday . Several other items have been reported found along the B-LOC I-LOC shore , most of it such personal items as wallets , shoes and jewelry . Investigators said they still do not have enough evidence to determine whether a bomb , a missile or mechanical failure caused the crash . FEATURE - Rich new detail on B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC unearthed . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-29 A freed black man writes to his still-enslaved wife , a mother pleads with B-PER I-PER on behalf of her son and a maimed soldier poses for an official photograph in newly reopened records that bring the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC back to life . Working in the basement of the B-ORG I-ORG , members of the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG are organising the military records of volunteers who fought for the B-LOC so that they can be preserved on microfilm . The faded documents have been stowed away in the B-ORG since it opened in 1935 and have rarely seen the light of day . Each soldier 's file is a gold mine of information : enlistment papers , muster rolls , medical records , discharge certificates , letters and photographs . Since the project began almost two years ago , corps volunteers have focused on B-MISC I-MISC troops , preparing records in time for the unveiling in B-LOC this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war . More than 185,000 black soldiers fought and 37,000 died . In one letter , a black soldier heading B-LOC wrote his wife , " though great is the present national difficulties yet I look forward to a brighter day when I shall have the oportunity of seeing you in the full enjoyment of freedom . " I would like to no ( sic ) if you are still in slavery if you are , it will not be long before we shall have crushed the system that now oppreses you for in the course of three months you shall have your liberty . Great is the outpouring of the coloured people that is now rallying with the heart of lions against the very curse that has separated you and me . " In another letter dated January 1865 , a well-to-do B-LOC matron wrote to B-PER to plead for her son , who faced a dishonourable discharge from the B-ORG . " B-PER is a prisoner for a thoughtless act of folly , while those who have done nothing for the cause are free , " she wrote . B-PER 's notation on the letter read : " If his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment , I will pardon and send him . " The soldier was subsequently pardoned . While the letters speak to the anguish of separation , a photograph of a black amputee speaks to the terrible physical cost of the war . In a picture required for his military discharge , Pvt . B-PER I-PER , with haunted eyes , posed bare-chested to reveal his missing arm and leg , blown off during a battle at B-LOC , B-LOC , in July 1864 . The work on black troops has provided new insight into the rhythms of plantation talk and culture , said B-PER I-PER , professor of history at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and editor of Gen . B-PER I-PER 's papers . " These ( writings ) are not only poetic but a linguistic treasure trove . This is the first generation of B-MISC I-MISC that really can express itself without fear and punishment , " B-PER said . " I think there 's probably a whole lot of material that would expand our understanding of the sociology of the war , " said B-PER I-PER , director of B-ORG I-ORG at B-ORG I-ORG in B-LOC . The war between the B-LOC and B-LOC raged for nearly four years , claimed the lives of half a million B-MISC and forever seared the nation 's consciousness . B-MISC records have already been preserved . They were put on microfilm about 30 years ago through a grant from the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . The B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG is mostly retirees joined by students during the school year . Director B-PER I-PER , who has shepherded the project from the beginning , predicts it will take up to a decade to complete . The work was inspired by a B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG plan to put computer databases at B-MISC I-MISC battlefields across the country so that B-MISC might research their ancestors . The records also provide insight into medical thinking of the day . One soldier was discharged because of " mental incapacity and inebetude ( sic ) of the brain , alleged by the Patient to be connected with a fall on the head but believed to arise from long continued and excessive masturbation . " B-PER arrives in B-LOC on day of re-nomination . B-LOC 1996-08-28 President B-PER I-PER arrived in B-LOC on Wednesday as the B-MISC convention prepared to re-nominate him for a second four-year term . B-PER flew in by helicopter from B-LOC I-LOC , B-LOC , after ending a four-day , 559-mile trip aboard a campaign train from B-LOC . New bomb attacks on B-LOC despite crackdown vow . B-PER I-PER B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-29 Separatist guerrillas planted two bombs overnight at government offices on the B-MISC B-MISC island of B-LOC despite fresh warnings of a crackdown by B-LOC , police said on Thursday . In the latest in a wave of attacks , a two kg ( four lb ) bomb seriously damaged two floors of B-ORG I-ORG offices located just 50 metres ( yards ) from a police station in the centre of the island capital B-ORG . No one was hurt . A second device , packed with five kg ( 10 lbs ) of explosive , was defused before it could go off , police said . The new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new " get-tough " policy by B-LOC toward the separatists , who seek greater autonomy . Interior Minister B-PER I-PER , under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups , told the daily B-ORG I-ORG in a statement he had given " firm orders " to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice . Judges on the island had accused B-LOC of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed . The latest bombing , close on the heels of the new orders , brought charges that police were powerless . " No searches , no arrests , no police reinforcements visible on the island , despite the ministry 's promises , " the daily B-ORG lamented . " On the island , as at the B-LOC I-LOC ( the B-ORG I-ORG 's B-LOC address ) , people are well aware who is who and who is doing what . It is time to end this nightly farce , " said the pro-government daily B-ORG I-ORG in an editorial . No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday 's incidents , which brought to 23 the number of guerrilla attacks on the resort island since mid-August , when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky seven-month truce . B-LOC has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence , principally directed against government targets , for two decades . The daily B-ORG I-ORG reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the B-MISC mainland on the principle that " 300 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 300 kilos in B-LOC " . The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government . B-LOC 's B-ORG to open B-LOC forest products bourse . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-MISC options and derivatives exchange B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG said on Thursday it would open an electronic bourse for forest industry products in B-LOC in the first half of 1997 . " Together with subsidiaries B-ORG , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG will open an international electronic bourse for forest products in the first half of 1997 , " B-ORG I-ORG said in a statement . The first commodity to be traded on the B-ORG bourse will be pulp , but B-ORG said trade would be extended to include products such as timber , recycled paper and other paper qualities . " Through the establishment of B-ORG , B-LOC will have a commodities bourse for forest products which complements existing bourses for oil , metals and ' softs ' ( coffee , sugar and cocoa ) , " B-ORG said . B-ORG was the result of a three-year project run in cooperation between B-ORG and representatives of the forest industry , the company said . Huge swings in the price of pulp over the past few years have made pulp producers ' profitability unpredictable , and made investing in new production capacity a risky business . " Without the ability to hedge prices , changes in the world market price for pulp has had an immediate impact on players ' profitability , " B-ORG said . It said global production of pulp amounted to around 200 million tonnes per year , of which around 20 percent or 40 million tonnes was sold on the spot market . At current prices , the value of this production was around $ 25 billion . B-ORG will be both a marketplace and a clearing house , B-ORG said , adding that the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG had been informed of B-ORG 's plans . B-ORG 's clearing operation will be covered by the parent company guarantee issued by B-ORG I-ORG to its wholly-owned bourses and clearing organisations . -- B-LOC newsroom , +46-8-700 1006 B-LOC oil stock levels fall . B-LOC 1996-08-29 Oil product inventories held in independent tankage in the B-LOC area were at the following levels , with week-ago and year-ago levels , industry sources said . All figures in thousands of tonnes : 29/8/96 22/8/96 1/9/95 Gasoline 400 400-425 425 Naphtha 50-75 75-100 50-75 Gas oil 1,600 1,650 1,850-1,900 Fuel oil 325 325-350 425 Jet kero 15 15-20 25 Motor gasoline stocks dipped slightly as barges left for B-LOC , but there were few inflows of cargoes . Naphtha inventories also dropped as B-LOC again took barges and no cargoes entered ARA . Gas oil stocks fell with some cargoes arriving from the former B-LOC I-LOC , but very fast throughput to markets in B-LOC , B-LOC and B-LOC . Fuel oil inventories dipped slightly with some straight-run arrivals , but fair bunkering demand removing more material . Jet fuel stocks lowered as the aviation sector bought . -- B-PER I-PER , B-LOC newsroom 31 20 504 5000 B-MISC anti-nuclear activists in pantomime protest . B-LOC 1996-08-29 About 200 B-MISC anti-nuclear activists protested on Thursday against nuclear waste transportation by re-enacting scenes from a demonstration they staged in May that turned into a violent clash with police . Activists dressed as police brandished batons and firing a theatre-prop water cannon at " demonstrators " . Police who had turned out in force all around the government quarter fearing violence looked on in amusement . Last May dozens of demonstrators and police were injured in violent clashes around the B-LOC nuclear waste depot as hundreds of protesters tried to block a delivery of waste by train and truck . B-LOC police arrest five over double Mafia killing . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-MISC Police said on Thursday they had arrested five people in connection with the slaying of the daughter and 14-year-old nephew of a Mafia boss earlier this week . B-PER I-PER , 22 , and B-PER I-PER were gunned down in a cemetery in this eastern B-MISC city on Tuesday in a crime which shocked even hardened anti-Mafia investigators . The arrests followed a tip-off from a married couple who unexpectedly showed up at investigators ' offices on Wednesday . " They wanted to get a weight off their consciences , " a police spokesman said . He added the couple had also shed light on the murder last year of the wife of Mafia boss B-PER I-PER . B-PER was shot as she knelt praying by the tomb of her young husband , who was himself killed last year in a Mafia ambush . B-PER , who had accompanied B-PER to the cemetary , tried to flee the lone gunman but was caught and killed . Thieves make off with cash from prison canteen . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-29 Thieves stole almost 2,000 B-MISC pounds ( $ 3,000 ) from the officers ' canteen of a B-LOC jail on Thursday while warders slept in a room upstairs . Police said the thieves intercepted a woman arriving to work at the canteen , forced her to open the safe where takings were kept and made off with the cash . While the robbery was going on , several officers were asleep in a room over the canteen , which is in the grounds of the prison on B-LOC 's southwest coast . B-MISC hold B-MISC for harassing hookers . B-LOC , B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-MISC police said on Thursday they had arrested a 61-year-old man after he fired blank shots at prostitutes he blamed for spreading B-MISC . The pensioner , named only as B-PER I-PER , told investigators he was infected with B-MISC , the B-MISC virus , and his wife had died of the disease . He did not say how they had contracted the illness . Police said the man had recently been spotted cruising red-light areas in this northern B-MISC city , hurling abuse at prostitutes and firing blank shots at them . Police said they found in his apartment two fake guns and a pistol that would only fire blanks . " Although fake guns are legal , the use he made of them means he could be tried , " a police official said . Bodies found at site of B-MISC jet crash - officials . B-LOC 1996-08-29 Bodies have been sighted but no survivors have yet been found at the site of Thursday 's crash of a B-MISC airliner on B-LOC 's remote B-MISC island of B-LOC , B-MISC officials said . " We have found dead people , " said B-PER I-PER , the island 's deputy governor , told B-MISC television . The B-MISC news agency B-ORG quoted another official on the island as saying no survivors had been found . The B-ORG I-ORG B-MISC I-MISC flight from B-LOC , carrying 129 passengers and a crew of 12 , crashed in bad weather 10 km ( six miles ) east of B-LOC , the island 's only airstrip , officials said . First rescuers arrived shortly after 1 p.m. ( 1100 B-MISC ) and reported soon afterwards that most of the three-engine jet 's wreckage was scattered around the top of the small B-LOC mountain while the rest had slid down the mountainside . Air traffic officials said they had lost contact with the flight , scheduled to arrive at around 10.15 a.m. ( 0815 B-MISC ) , shortly before it was due to land . B-LOC is a B-MISC coal-mining settlement . The only other community is in the B-MISC village of B-LOC . B-LOC and B-LOC share the island 's resources under a treaty dating back to the 1920s . Galeforce winds and heavy rains batter B-LOC . B-LOC 1996-08-29 Torrential rains and galeforce winds battered B-LOC on Thursday causing widespread damage as some areas had more rainfall in 24 hours than they normally get in a month , the meteorological office said . Cellars were flooded , trees uprooted and roofs damaged , but there were no reports of any injuries , an interior affairs ministry spokesman said . Some trains were delayed as fallen trees blocked lines . B-LOC received 5.6 cm ( 2.24 inches ) of water in the past 24 hours -- compared to an average 7.4 cm ( 2.96 inches ) per month -- but in several communes in the south of the country up to 8 cm ( 3.2 inches ) fell , the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) said . The B-ORG spokesman said that near the eastern city of B-LOC , a group of boy scouts camping in a low-lying meadow had to be evacuated as water flooded their tents . The rain also severely hindered B-MISC investigators ' excavations in the southern village of B-LOC , where they are looking for bodies in one of the houses of the main character in a paedophile sex-and-murder scandal . But the coastal towns got off lightly as the flooding that had been expected due to a combination of spring tides and high winds failed to materialise . B-ORG shares up 65 pesetas on H1 results . B-LOC 1996-08-29 Shares in B-MISC oil and chemicals group B-ORG were up 65 pesetas to 4,150 after the company announced net first half profits fell 1.1 percent to 61.45 billion pesetas on the previous year . This was close to the market 's forecast of net profits of 61.94 billion . Shares in B-ORG shot up 100 pesetas to 4,175 shortly after the figures , having traded down 10 pesetas before the figures were released . " It 's madness , " said an analyst at a B-LOC brokerage , adding that the market had overreacted to the news . " People were waiting for the results to come out before buying . The rise has been very quick and very crazy . " He predicted a correction , perhaps as early as this session . -- B-ORG I-ORG +34 1 585 2161 B-LOC forces kill guerrillas - papers . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-MISC security forces killed four B-MISC guerrillas on Tuesday in a village south of the capital B-LOC , an B-MISC newspaper said on Thursday . The armed militants were shot dead in B-LOC village 90 km ( 56 miles ) south of B-LOC , B-ORG newspaper said . Security forces also killed an unspecified number of members of a rebel gang on Wednesday in the B-LOC suburb of B-LOC , B-ORG I-ORG newspaper reported . An estimated 50,000 people , mostly B-MISC militants and security forces members , have been killed in violence pitting B-MISC guerrillas against government forces since early 1992 , when authorities cancelled a general election in which B-MISC had taken a commanding lead . B-MISC hold two men on child sex-abuse charges . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-MISC police said on Thursday they had arrested two men suspected of sexually abusing a captive 13-year-old girl , but did not believe the case was linked to others in B-LOC . The men , both B-MISC aged about 40 , were arrested last Saturday in the western town of B-LOC in a raid on a luxury boat owned by one of them . The girl was being held on the boat and had sought help from a passer-by , police chief inspector B-PER I-PER said . " This is an individual case and I do n't have any evidence linking the suspects to any other cases , " B-PER said . The girl was taken to hospital . The men could face charges carrying up to six to 10 years in prison , he said . Witnesses had reported seeing many young women and some girls who looked clearly underage at parties around the boat in recent weeks , the daily newspaper B-ORG said .

" We do not expect any burden on our 1996 results from currency markets , " B-PER told B-ORG in an interview . B-ORG would have been able to report a profit 300 million marks higher in 1995 if exchange rates had stayed the same as in 1994 , B-PER had told a shareholder meeting last April .

B-LOC 1996-08-29 Fertilisers and saplings maker B-ORG I-ORG said on Thursday in a statement it expected a falling result trend in the latter half of the year , but a full-year profit was nevertheless likely . " Due to natural seasonal fluctuations in operations , the end-year result trend will be falling , but based on the early year result trend a profitable result is likely to be achieved , " B-ORG said in its January-June interim report . In 1995 , B-ORG reported a 5.6 million markka loss before extraordinary items and tax . In the first half , B-ORG posted a 6.1 million markka profit , up from 0.7 million . -- B-ORG I-ORG +358 - 0 - 680 50 245 B-MISC untroubled by margin pressure . B-LOC 1996-08-29 The chairman of B-MISC components and engineering group B-ORG I-ORG said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets . In an interview following its first-half results , which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past , Sir B-PER I-PER said B-ORG had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets . Looking at market prospects , he said : " I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it 's been in the first half . " " It 's very difficult to predict the market ( trend ) this year . It could be better , or it could be worse , " B-PER added , echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries . " You can see anxieties in B-LOC and B-LOC , in particular , beginning to grow and develop . B-LOC , however , is looking a little better , " he said . Compared with the end of last year , when B-ORG predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 , B-PER said : " I think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half . " Against this background , B-PER said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins , which had slipped to 9.5 percent from 11.3 percent a year ago . " I think the figure of 9.5 percent on the first half , when you consider the fact that we 've been destocking , the fairly mixed customer demand , and the fact that we sold the ( southern B-MISC ) mines actually is not bad . " It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 10 percent again , " he added , saying : " We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 10 percent profit margins over the cycle . " " We 've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that 's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances -- we 're rather used to it . And we feel very confident that we 're doing all the right things , " B-PER said . " When the ( profit ) figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction , " he added . Commenting on the continued struggle to get control of B-MISC piston maker B-ORG , which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles , B-PER said B-ORG 's confidence " continues to improve " that it may eventually be able to proceed . -- B-PER I-PER , B-ORG I-ORG , +44 171 542 8716 Earthquake jolts B-MISC I-MISC B-LOC I-LOC .

It said the quake , centred near the small town of B-LOC , was strongly felt in the cities of B-LOC and B-LOC . Some minor damage had been reported in the spa town of B-LOC . B-LOC I-LOC is prone to frequent earthquakes but they rarely cause major damage . The country has only 3.5 million people in an area about the size of B-LOC or B-LOC . B-LOC I-LOC 's B-PER sees growth , smooth transition . B-PER I-PER B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-LOC I-LOC Financial Secretary B-PER I-PER said on Thursday he expected the territory 's economy to keep growing at around five percent but with some fluctuations from year to year . B-PER , who made the remarks during a visit to B-LOC I-LOC , also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the B-LOC I-LOC dollar pegged to its B-LOC counterpart , and said negotiations with B-LOC on next year 's budget were going smoothly . B-LOC I-LOC 's economy grew by only 3.1 percent in the first quarter , down from 5.9 percent a year earlier , and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 1996 year . Second quarter growth estimates will be released when the B-LOC I-LOC government issues its half-yearly economic report on Friday . " Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid , " B-PER told a news conference after meeting B-LOC I-LOC Finance Minister B-PER I-PER . " There will be fluctuations in individual years , but it wo n't be a big margin , " he said . He said inflation was under control and the B-LOC I-LOC dollar was " rock solid " . Its link to the B-LOC dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past 12 years . " There 's absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change . A lot of investment in B-LOC I-LOC , some of which ( is ) by B-LOC , is predicated on the link continuing . " B-LOC will hand over B-LOC I-LOC to B-MISC sovereignty at midnight on June 30 , 1997 . B-PER said three sets of meetings with B-MISC authorities on B-LOC I-LOC 's 1997-98 budget , which will span the transition period , had gone smoothly . " None of our basic precepts have been challenged . " B-LOC I-LOC will retain its own currency after the handover , run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves . It will have no duty to contribute any taxes to B-LOC , B-PER said . He described the condition of the property market as " very good indeed " . " You know , we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years . Because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures , but they are not draconian measures , and we brought it down to earth . " B-PER said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce . The government would put land on the market to stop rentals " going through the roof " , but this would mean reclamation , with possible environmental problems . " There will be on the whole a slightly upward climb , consistent with our economic growth rate , " he said in reference to the property market . B-PER , the third senior figure in the government after the governor and chief secretary , said his stated aim was to serve as financial secretary for two years under B-MISC rule and three years under B-LOC . B-LOC dollar ends higher , narrow trade seen .

The B-LOC dollar fell in early trade on month-end B-LOC dollar demand , but the downtrend was later reversed as B-LOC dollar liquidity tightened . " Banks do not want to hold big B-LOC dollar positions at this moment , " said one dealer , adding that the rate was likely to hover around current levels .

Sentiment is a bit gloomy because people are focusing on the weak recovery in the economy at the moment , " said a dealer with a B-MISC bank .

B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-LOC sought on Thursday to play down a fire bomb attack on a B-LOC consulate earlier this week , saying it was being treated as a criminal rather than a political act , the official B-LOC news agency said . The police are still investigating the incident . It is evident the happening is not politically motivated but just an ordinary criminal act , the news agency quoted B-MISC I-MISC military commander Major-General B-PER as saying . The Tuesday morning attack on the consulate in B-MISC second largest city of B-LOC , caused slight damage to a guard house before being quickly extinguished , a spokesman at the B-LOC embassy in B-LOC , 700 km ( 430 miles ) west of B-LOC , said on Wednesday . No one was injures , he said . Nobody should try and exaggerate it by calling it a bomb because it was just a molotov cocktail , B-PER said . He said police were investigating the incident and patrols around diplomatic offices in B-LOC would be stepped up . B-ORG I-ORG - 6mth parent forecast .

B-LOC civil servants contest ban on B-LOC panel . B-LOC I-LOC 1996-08-29 Senior B-LOC I-LOC civil servants were given the go-ahead on Thursday to challenge a government ban on them standing for the B-MISC panel to choose the territory 's first post-handover leader and lawmakers . The B-ORG I-ORG ruled that a judicial hearing contesting the ban would be heard on September 11 , three days before the nomination period for the B-ORG I-ORG closes . The government maintains the ban , announced earlier this month , is necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest because civil servants are involved in determining government policy . Civil servants argue the ban stymies their political rights . The 400-strong B-ORG I-ORG will select B-LOC I-LOC 's future chief executive to replace the B-MISC governor and a provisional legislature to take over from the elected chamber which B-LOC plans to dissolve . B-LOC I-LOC , a B-MISC colony for more than 150 years , will be handed back to B-LOC at midnight on June 30 next year . B-LOC intends to dismantle the territory 's first fully-elected legislature because it opposes B-LOC 's recent electoral reforms and install an interim appointed chamber , a decision that has generated considerable controversy . The judicial review sought by directorate-grade bureaucrats will apply to only about 1,000 of the approximately 33,000 civil servants affected . Police unions are not contesting the ban , which affects all 27,000 officers , and nor are the very top tier of B-LOC I-LOC 's mandarin class , the policy secretaries . More than 16,000 application forms for places on the B-ORG I-ORG have been handed out since the nomination period opened . It closes on September 14 . B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG expected to shut B-ORG I-ORG . B-LOC 1996-08-29 B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) is expected to shutdown its 60,000 barrel-per-day ( bpd ) crude distillation unit ( B-ORG ) in September , an industry source said on Thursday . " They think something is stuck , " the source said . " But nothing has been decided as they are still waiting for an X-ray machine to determine the problem . " The source said the problem was discovered during the past month during which time B-ORG I-ORG 's production has varied from maximum capacity of 60,000 bpd to as low as 40,000 bpd , depending on the crude being run . " We are having a lot of problems , " said a source . An earlier problem with B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-ORG arose on July 24 when an industry source said the B-ORG would be closed down briefly in August for repairs to a heat exchanger . But by mid-August , a company spokesman said repairs had been carried out without any shutdown . The 285,000 bpd B-ORG refinery is co-owned by the B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG , the joint-venture of B-LOC majors B-ORG I-ORG and B-ORG I-ORG . -- B-ORG I-ORG ( +65-8703086 ) B-ORG H1 net rises to 332.66 mln baht .

" A preview of the second half of 1996 does not reveal any signs of a significant improvement in market conditions , " B-ORG said in a statement released ahead of its earnings conference . For the first six months of the year , B-ORG said it posted a group pre-tax loss of 84.5 million schillings from a profit of 160 million in the year-ago period . The group attributed the first-half losses to weak demand and falling prices of viscose fibres , as well as sluggish economies in the B-LOC . -- B-PER I-PER , B-LOC newsroom , +431 53112 274 B-LOC faults B-LOC over B-MISC gathering . B-LOC 1996-08-28 B-LOC , fighting a vicious war against B-MISC fundamentalist guerrillas , attacked B-LOC on Wednesday for allowing B-MISC groups to meet in B-LOC . The B-MISC gathering , due to be held in B-LOC on September 8 , has triggered concern and anger in several other B-MISC countries like B-LOC which is also fighting armed B-MISC fundamentalists . B-MISC I-MISC groups have also voiced protest because they said B-MISC I-MISC B-ORG as well as the banned B-MISC B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG ( B-ORG ) are among those radical B-MISC attending the conference . A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on B-MISC television that B-LOC " has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the B-MISC and B-MISC world . " " B-LOC expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism , " the spokesman said , adding the B-MISC government has asked the B-MISC embassy in B-LOC for clarifications . The B-MISC ambassador in B-LOC has also asked for clarification from the B-ORG I-ORG over the meeting of B-MISC groups . B-LOC said " they are clearly working to undermine the stability " of B-MISC countries . B-MISC Foreign Secretary B-PER I-PER said on Tuesday from B-LOC his government would only take action against the planned B-MISC gathering in B-LOC if B-MISC law was broken . " People who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in B-LOC , " he said . An estimated 50,000 people , including more than 110 foreigners , have been killed in B-LOC 's violence pitting B-MISC rebels against government forces since early 1992 when authorities in B-LOC cancelled a general election in which B-ORG had taken a commanding lead . B-ORG I-ORG CONTENTS - B-ORG L 218 OF AUGUST 28 , 1996 . * B-MISC I-MISC ( B-ORG ) B-MISC I-MISC of 30 July 1996 amending B-MISC ( B-ORG ) B-MISC I-MISC laying down provisions for the implementation of B-MISC I-MISC ( B-ORG ) B-MISC I-MISC establishing the B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC END OF DOCUMENT . B-LOC I-LOC ponders B-PER 's role if B-PER wins . B-PER I-PER B-LOC I-LOC The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on B-LOC I-LOC this week as financial pundits debated whether B-PER I-PER might forgo a second term as B-ORG secretary if President B-PER is re-elected . Concern centred on the currency markets since B-PER 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar . Speculation that B-PER might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future B-ORG post during television interviews at the B-MISC convention in B-LOC this week . Should B-PER leave , B-LOC I-LOC would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him . B-PER 's predecessor at the B-ORG , B-PER I-PER , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with B-LOC . " Obviously , under the B-PER administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , " said B-PER I-PER , an international economist at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG " Under B-PER , the B-LOC has certainly looked for a strong dollar . " That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC lows of 1.3438 B-MISC marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 B-MISC yen on April 19 , 1995 . Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen . B-PER was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on B-LOC I-LOC , part of which were spent as co-chairman of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-ORG . " B-PER has done a fine job in that position , " said B-PER I-PER , a portfolio manager at B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds . " Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . " Fear that a new B-ORG secretary might favour a return to B-MISC policy could spell trouble for financial markets . Some overseas investors might shy away from buying B-LOC stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening . As for B-ORG I-ORG securities , B-PER explained that B-PER I-PER 's reappointment as chairman of the B-ORG I-ORG and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether B-PER continues at the B-ORG . " Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the B-LOC I-LOC , " said B-PER , adding that could hurt B-LOC stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds . Still , markets may have little to fear from any B-PER successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results . If that is true , then any new B-ORG chief would need to be as effective as B-PER in convincing markets that the B-LOC I-LOC does indeed want a strong currency . " If he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' What 's your view on the dollar ? ' " said B-PER I-PER , portfolio manager of B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG . " And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they 'd better say exactly the same thing ( as B-PER ) , if not stronger , " B-PER said . " Otherwise , you get selling out of B-LOC and B-LOC again .

B-LOC 's B-PER I-PER fought off a spirited challenge from B-MISC B-PER I-PER to take the title for a second year . B-LOC , the only nation to have two riders in the field , made full use of their numerical superiority . B-PER I-PER helped B-PER to build an unbeatable points lead before snatching the bronze medal . B-PER , a former medallist in the points event , led the race at half distance . " I went so close this time , but having two riders certainly gave the B-MISC an advantage , " she said . The first six riders lapped the field , which left former world champion B-PER I-PER of the B-LOC down in seventh place despite having the second highest points score .
